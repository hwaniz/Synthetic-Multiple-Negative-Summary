{"article": "The ex-king of Spain, Juan Carlos, was leading a double life and having an affair with a German aristocrat for the last ten years of his reign, according to a new book that claims they were 'a couple, pure and simple'. The bombshell allegation is that Juan Carlos was romancing Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein and was so smitten with her that he even contemplated divorcing his wife, Sofia, according to Final De Partida \u2013 or End Game \u2013 by Ana Romero, which sold out within 24 hours. Romero, a former royal correspondent for the El Mundo daily, said at the book's launch in Madrid: 'What do you see (in the book)? Well, the double life which Juan Carlos led during a long time, a double life which obviously has not gone well.' Scroll down for video . The former King Juan Carlos greets Corinna Sayn-Wittgenstein in at an awards ceremony in Barcelona in May 2006: \u00a0A new book claims that they have been lovers for a decade . Glamorous: The aristocrat is 27 years younger than the former Spanish king. Their affair is said to have ended in 2014 . The author's claims are based on 100 interviews with anonymous sources. She said that the affair ended in 2014 when Juan Carlos abdicated in favour of his son, Felipe. He married former Queen Sofia in 1962 and became king in 1975. Romero added: '[Final De Partida] \u00a0is a chronicle of the end of an era, when Spaniards turned their backs on Juan Carlos. The first print run of 25,000 copies nearly sold out on Wednesday less than 24 hours since the book hit stores and its publishers have already ordered a second print run. The 77-year-old former king's friendship with Sayn-Wittgenstein, 50, who is divorced from the German prince whose name she bears, emerged in 2012 when Juan Carlos was flown home from Botswana on a private jet after suffering an injury while on an expensive elephant-hunting holiday. Juan Carlos, pictured here with Queen Sofia in May 2014, was said to be so smitten with\u00a0Sayn-Wittgenstein that he considered a divorce . The German woman, who is 27 years younger than Juan Carlos, was among those accompanying the monarch on the trip, which sparked outrage at a time when Spain was grappling with record unemployment and risked needing an international bailout. Juan Carlos, who won respect for his role in guiding Spain's transition to democracy after the death of longtime dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975, made an unprecedented apology for his behaviour but his popularity took a serious hit. Romero said the uproar over the hunting trip, combined with a string of health problems and a corruption scandal implicating his youngest daughter Cristina, created the 'perfect storm' which pushed Juan Carlos to abdicate. Sayn-Wittgenstein was born a Danish national in 1964 in Frankfurt, Germany to parents Finn B\u00f6nning Larsen and Ingrid Sauer. She has been married twice, in 1989 to English businessman Philip Adkins, with whom he had a daughter, and in 2000 to Prince Casimir zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, having ended her first marriage in 1995. She had a son with the prince in 2000, but they divorced in 2005, though she carried on using her married name. Currently residing in Monaco, Sayn-Wittgenstein was asked by the prince of the microstate to help bring in business. She used to be the director of Apollonia Associates, a company that connects 'people, platforms and organisations to create sustainable value'.

There were no other specific threats to Anzac Day events in other cities, but Mr Abbott said there would be a strong police presence across Australia nonetheless. Security at the Gallipoli ceremony was a matter for the Turkish government, but Australia had been co-operating in the lead up to the event. Four thousand Turkish police and security personnel would be deployed on the peninsula. 'I want to assure people that everything authorities can do to keep you safe is being done,' Mr Abbott said.

{"article": "Poland said it is demanding a formal apology from the U.S. over the comments made by FBI director James Comey (pictured above) The US ambassador for Poland has been forced to apologise for comments made by the head of the FBI who blamed Polish people for helping the Nazis kill Jews during the Holocaust. James Coney had written an editorial opinion piece for the Washington Post claiming Poland shares responsibility for the Holocaust with Germany. The piece sparked outrage among Polish politicians and media. US Ambassador Stephen Mull met with the Polish deputy foreign affairs minister and apologised for the comments. He said:\u00a0'I made clear that the opinion that Poland is in any way responsible for the Holocaust is not the position of the United States. 'Nazi Germany alone bears responsibility.' Mr Mull said he now had 'a lot of work' to do to rectify the situation. Comey's April 16 opinion piece in the Washington Post\u00a0stated that Poland played a role in Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews in the Holocaust. 'In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn't do something evil,' Comey wrote. The piece was titled\u00a0Why I require FBI agents to visit the Holocaust Museum. 'They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do,' it continues. Scroll down for video . Poland's president Bronislaw Komorowski told public television that Comey's comments showed a 'lack of historical knowledge' and were an 'insult to thousands of Poles who helped Jews'. On Sunday foreign ministry spokesman Marcin Wojciechowski wrote on Twitter that Mull would 'receive a note of protest and a summons for an apology.' US Ambassador Stephen Mull apologised to Poland . The US Ambassador was quick to present an informal apology at memorial ceremonies in the Polish capital on Sunday marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Six million Polish citizens were killed under Nazi Germany's occupation of Poland during World War II. While half of the victims were Jewish, the other half were Christian. Historical records show instances of Poles turning against their Jewish neighbours, either killing them or giving them up to the Nazis. Poles also risked their lives and families to save Jews. In 2012, US President Barack Obama caused outrage in Warsaw when he labelled a World War II Nazi German facility in occupied Poland used to process Jews for extermination a 'Polish death camp'. He subsequently expressed 'regret' at what he called his inadvertent use of the erroneous term 'Polish death camp.' Poland's government keenly watches the global media for descriptions of former Nazi German death camps as 'Polish. It says the term - even if used simply as a geographical indicator - can give the impression that Poland bore responsibility for the Holocaust.

{"article": "For the first time this year, Nasa\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has spotted its robotic companion on the surface of the red planet. The orbiting spacecraft captured a shot of Curiosity near the base of Mount Sharp in Gale Crater. But interestingly, the rover\u2019s tracks are not visible - possibly because they have been swept away by the Martian weather. The HiRise camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches (25cm) per pixel, allowing it to spot the rover on the surface. It is seen here in the full image, circled. The rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light-toned outcrops of rock . The image was taken using the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRise) camera on the Martian satellite, from a height of 187 miles (300km) above the surface. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 900kg (2,000lbs). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. It is not the first time it has spotted Curiosity, or indeed other rovers, on the surface - but it is the first time in 2015. The HiRise camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches (25cm) per pixel, allowing it to see Curiosity, which is the size of a car. In this image the rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light-toned outcrops of rock. These rocks are part of the Pahrump Hills in the Murray Formation, which is an area of sandstones, siltstones and calcium sulphate veins on the surface. They are the lowest exposed rocks of Mount Sharp - also known as Aeolis Mons - which Nasa is planning to send Curiosity up at some point. In the image the rover had recently completed a drive of about 75ft (23 metres) during its 949th day on Mars - also known as a sol. North is towards the top in the image, with the entire view spanning about 1,640ft (500 metres) across. Curiosity has been driving a route through an area called Artist\u2019s Drive, on its way to the higher layers of Mount Sharp after examining Pahrump Hills. Its ultimate science destination, Logan Pass, is at the bottom left of the image. Nasa scientists in California have revealed a distant image of Curiosity (shown). It was taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter from 187 miles up. One interesting aspect is that the rover's tracks cannot be seen. This may be due to Martian weather or they blend in with the surface . Here's the view from the surface: Curiosity took this image of Artist's Drive around a similar time that the MRO spacecraft spotted it from orbit. The rover is now on its way to a region called Logan Pass . Aside from keeping track of the rover, this image also allows scientists to monitor nearby sand dunes. And the absence of the rover\u2019s tracks also hints at one of two possibilities. It may be that Martian wind has swept them away, or it could be that the dark sand dug up by the wheels as they move is a similar colour to the surface, and thus indistinguishable. The last time Curiosity was spotted from orbit was more than four months ago. Another benefit of taking this sort of image is to find upcoming landmarks that might be of interest for the rover. Curiosity has now been on Mars for almost 1,000 days, having landed on 6 August 2012.

{"article": "Disgraced former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell made his final written plea to a federal appeals court Wednesday, arguing that the favors he did for a wealthy businessman were routine courtesies and not part of a bribery scheme. The onetime rising Republican star made the argument in a 54-page brief in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel of the court will conduct a hearing on his appeal of his public corruption convictions on May 12. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell fought back tears outside a federal court building after he was sentenced for selling the influence of his office to the CEO of a dietary supplements company . McDonnell was sentenced to two years in federal prison for public corruption . McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted in a joint trial in September of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his company's nutritional supplements. Bob McDonnell was sentenced to two years in prison and his wife to one year and one day, but they remain free while they pursue separate appeals. 'Governor McDonnell never promised anything and never did anything besides extend to Williams the sorts of routine courtesies elected officials throughout the country extend to donors and benefactors every day,' McDonnell's lawyers wrote in the latest filing. They were responding to the government's brief urging the court to uphold the criminal convictions. Former first lady Maureen McDonnell, left, was sentenced to a year and a day . Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams testified under an immunity deal, admitting that he paid the governor with lavish perks in exchange for helping him secure university backing for his 'miracle cure' Anatabloc\u00a0product . Prosecutors had written in a 93-page submission to the court that McDonnell's actions fit the definition of 'official acts' even better than those taken by former Louisiana Rep. William Jefferson, who is serving 13 years in prison for taking bribes in exchange for using his influence to broker business deals with government leaders in Africa. Jefferson was famously caught with $100,000 in bribe money hidden in his freezer. 'Here, defendant directed his action toward subordinate state employees within the branch of government that he controlled as governor,' they wrote, while in the Jefferson case 'a congressman took action through meetings, letters, and the like directed at other government agencies or foreign governments.' One of McDonnell's chief claims on appeal is that the favors he did for Williams did not amount to 'official acts' covered by federal bribery law. In the new filing, he argues that a meeting McDonnell arranged for Williams with an administration official was 'innocuous' and that there was nothing special about an event at the Executive Mansion to launch Star's signature product, the anti-inflammatory Anatabloc. 'Governor McDonnell arrived late, made neutral comments, and left. He never asked anyone to do anything for Williams,' the brief says. Star Scientific, the maker of Anatabloc, the anti-inflammatory supplement at the center of the McDonnell trial, halted sales of the product in August 2014 . Worse than the freezer bribes? Prosecutors argue McDonnell's behavior was a better fit with bribery laws than that of convicted former congressman William Jefferson, who his $100,000 of his bribe cash in his freezer . McDonnell argues that in addition to mischaracterizing such events as 'official acts,' the government incorrectly suggested that McDonnell kept his staff in the dark about most of Williams' gifts. Among the gifts were almost $20,000 worth of designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell, vacations, golf outings and $15,000 for a daughter's wedding. The former governor also renewed claims that the judge improperly denied separate trials for Bob and Maureen McDonnell and that he failed to adequately question jurors about pretrial news coverage. Williams, who was seeking state-financed research on Anatabloc while lavishing the McDonnells with gifts and loans, testified under immunity for the prosecution.", "reference": "Bob McDonnell used his office to benefit a nutritional supplement company whose president lavished gifts on him and his wife .\nHis lawyers argue that he never performed any 'official acts' for Star Scientific, a company that sought support for his 'Anatabloc' supplement .\nMcDonnell was sentenced to two years in prison and his wife got one year and one day; they're both free pending appeals .\nThree-judge federal court panel will hear the former governor's appeal on May 12 .", "pred_summary": "Disgraced former Virginia Gov.

But Kai Windsor started life as a girl \u2013 and knew from the age of three that he had been born into the wrong body. Christened Kaia, he would shun traditional girls\u2019 toys in favour of kicking a ball around. By four, he refused to wear dresses \u2013 and at six he wanted his hair cut short and developed a boyish awkwardness around girls. By nine, he had finally broken the truth to his mother Rachel, 37, telling her: \u2018I\u2019m really a boy.\u2019 Now, at the age of ten, Kai is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty to stop him developing into a woman. Miss Windsor, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: \u2018As a toddler, Kai only wanted to play ball. As a girl, he had no interest in any dolls and made a beeline for boy\u2019s toys. \u2018And as soon as he began school, he only wanted to wear trousers as the other boys did. Soon after, I noticed he went red whenever girls were around.\u2019 Kai is not alone in facing gender problems. The number of transgender referrals to the NHS for children under 11 has quadrupled since 2009. Like many parents in her situation, Miss Windsor had never heard of children facing such issues. But the single mother, who runs a health juice business, said Kai had \u2018amazing support\u2019 from his primary school. He was given counselling when his schoolwork started to suffer, and later decided to confront the issue head-on. \u2018They were the ones who suggested Kai should have counselling,\u2019 she said. \u2018Then when he came out as transgender, they sent a letter out to all the parents in his year to explain he now wanted to be referred to as a boy. \u2018Staff then held a special lesson for all the year to explain about being transgender. And now they are even in the process of building unisex toilets to make life easier for Kai and other children like him.\u2019 Kaia pretty in pink, aged four, pictured left, and dressing up as a pirate, at five, pictured right . When Kai was born there was no outward sign he was anything other than female. Miss Windsor, who also has a daughter Jasmine, 16, from a previous relationship, said: \u2018As a toddler I usually put Kaia in dresses and bought her lots of dolls. Meanwhile, as her blonde hair grew, I put in pigtails. It simply never occurred to me she wouldn\u2019t be as feminine as her sister.\u2019 She added: \u2018Looking back Kai knew then he was a boy. He had no interest in dolls, preferring to play with a football. And when we were out he\u2019d head straight for the boy\u2019s section in shops, asking for Spiderman toys.\u2019 At seven, Kai wanted his hair cut shorter. But his grades started suffering and he was later given counselling at school. Within a few weeks, his behaviour and schoolwork improved and last year he officially became transgender after telling his mother one morning. Transgender Kai is now happy in his skin at last and is now set to undergo hormone treatment . Meanwhile, his grades immediately improved. \u2018Once people stopped referring to Kai as a girl and he could just be the little boy he wanted, he was so much happier,\u2019 she said. Kai is now set to have hormone treatment to curb puberty. If at the age of 16, he wants to complete the full transition to an adult man, he will be offered gender reassignment surgery. Miss Windsor added: \u2018There have been plenty of tears. It is hard to see your child going through such turmoil. But whatever happens I will always be there to support Kai. \u2018And right now it is just a wonderful relief to see him happy in his own skin at last.\u2019", "reference": "Kai Windsor knew from  three that he had been born in the wrong body .\nBy four he wouldn't wear dresses and by six he wanted to cut his hair short .\nKai came out at school as a transgender and is now referred to as a boy .\nAt age of 10 he is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty .", "pred_summary": "Kai Windsor started life as a girl - but knew from the age of three that he was a boy.\n shunned traditional girls\u2019 toys in favour of kicking a ball around.\nDecided to confront the issue head-on at school, and has had 'amazing support' from teachers.\nNumber of transgender referrals to NHS for children under 11 has quadrupled since 2009."}

In line with EU regulations, the first line of treatment for organic fish should be 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution', before .

'Risk': Under EU regulations, organic farmers must first use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution' to treat ill fish, which has been criticised by British and Norwegian vets (stock image) The directives, outlined in the 2009 European regulation on organic aquaculture, are set to be brought into national law in non-EU Norway, which has caused vets to see red. Section 7 of the regulations calls for organic farmers to use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homoeopathic dilution', as their first port of call when their fish are ill . After this, the 'veterinary treatments' section outlines that farmers may use  'plants and their extracts not having anaesthetic effects'. As well as the directive to use homeopathic treatments, organic fish farmers are only allowed to resort to mainstream medical treatments a maximum of twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification. This has been criticised by the \u00a0Norwegian Veterinary Association (NVA) as could mean that fish are not getting the correct treatment in time, causing them unnecessary suffering. Danger: British and Norwegian vets have called the EU directives on organic fish treatment 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment' 'We think it's totally unacceptable from a scientific point of view because there's no scientific basis for using homeopathy,' Ellef Blakstad, the head of the Norwegian Veterinary Association, told The Local.no. 'If you start using homeopathy, you prolong the time when the animals are not getting adequate treatment and that's a threat to animal welfare.' Harsh: Farmers are only allowed to use mainstream medical treatments a twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification (stock image) The criticism from Norway has been echoed by the British Veterinary Association, saying use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' The British Veterinary Association (BVA) cannot endorse the use of homeopathic remedies, or indeed any products, making therapeutic claims, which have no proven efficacy,' British Veterinary Association President John Blackwell told MailOnline. 'As with any treatment for disease using medicines, BVA believes that veterinary medicinal products must be evidence-based, with any medicinal claims made by a manufacturer supported. 'If homeopathic remedies are used without proven effectiveness on farmed fish across the EU, including the UK, the consequence could be serious animal health and welfare detriment, which would be counterproductive to both animal health and to the farmed fish industry in the UK.' Homepathic treatments are based on the principle that 'like cures like', whereby a highly diluted substance that causes the symptoms  in a healthy person, can also cure similar symptoms in a sick person.

Duli Hembrom wrote to the principal of\u00a0Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya after failing to convince her parents to call off the wedding, which is due to take place in two days. She wrote: 'I do not want to get married, I took an oath at the time of admission that I will not get married before I turn 18.' She added that she wanted the teacher to stop the marriage 'whichever way possible', the India Times\u00a0reported. It is thought the 'oath' Duli refers to is the school's promise she had to make when she started, but exactly what it included is not known.

He told the Hindustan Times\u00a0that it was difficult to find a suitable match for a grown-up girl.

Between 2011 and 2020 more than 140 million girls will become child brides globally, analysts estimate. Aarati Benera, a women\u2019s rights activist, described child marriage as 'illegal and a social evil'.

Above, women and girls sit waiting to be married in a mass wedding ceremony in India . Despite numerous campaigns from many of the world's largest charities and NGOs, the issue of child brides remains a global concern. In 2013 there were around 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. This is despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed  during British rule in 1929, specifying that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Meanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old, analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households. And girls younger than 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s.

{"article": "We know him as 'Success Kid' - the toddler with a clenched fist and look of satisfaction who's become the internet's most positive meme. But now Sam Griner is eight years old and is using his online fame to help out his sick dad. His mother, Laney Griner from Jacksonville, Florida, set up a\u00a0GoFundMe page to raise the $75,000 her husband, Justin, needs for the kidney transplant and years of subsequent medications. 'Please help us reach our goal so that Justin may get the pre-treatments and transplant he desperately needs,' she wrote on the fundraising page. Scroll down for video . Plea: Sammy Griner is pictured with his 39-year-old father, Justin, who needs a kidney transplant . Famous face: Sammy is better known as the face of the 'Success Kid' meme. His mother snapped the photo - which actually shows him just moments before trying to put sand in his mouth - when he was 11 months . 'His mother died from this disease, please help us write a different story for Justin and his son, Sam.' By Tuesday afternoon, the page had raised more than $38,000 of the goal. Although Griner initially decided against using the notoriety of 'Success Kid' to help raise funds, she eventually spoke to\u00a0The Daily Dot about the campaign because of her fears for her husband. Justin, 39, discovered his kidneys were failing before the birth of their son and he now spends about four hours a day, three days a week undergoing dialysis, Mrs Griner told\u00a0ABC News. He is unable to work and never has energy, she said. The longer he is on the dialysis, the higher the chance that he could develop complications. 'Six years on dialysis is getting to be a long time,' she said. 'It's wearing on him.' Sign of success: His face has since been used to create the internet's most positive meme, pictured . Grimace: An image shows Sammy, who is now eight years old, posing beside a t-shirt bearing his face . The funds will supplement the money Medicare puts towards the procedure. The family will also need $12,000 for just the first year of medications, although he'll be on drugs for the rest of his life. It is also not yet clear where the kidney will come from and so the family is also using the GoFundMe page to ask strangers to see if they could be a match. So far, no friends or family members have proved a match, she told The Daily Dot, and getting on a list for a deceased donor can take at least five years. 'We certainly prefer a living donor because the prognosis seems to be much better,' she said. 'We're certainly not opposed [to waiting for a donor], but obviously, the sooner the better for us all.' To help raise awareness about her husband's need for a kidney, she turned to her son for help. Mrs Griner had snapped the photo of Sammy on the beach when he was 11 months old. The image looks as if he is punching the air - but she said he was actually about to put sand in his mouth. Close: Justin, pictured, discovered his kidneys were failing before Sam was born and receives dialysis . Appeal: The boy's mother, Laney, said she initially didn't want to use the boy's famous face to raise funds because she wanted the focus to be on Justin, but she said she just wants to see him healthy . She put the photo on her Flickr page in 2007 and two years later, she noticed that it was being used for memes before eventually becoming the beloved 'Success Kid' meme around 2010. His face has featured on billboard, TV commercials and t-shirts, which Mrs Griner called both 'weird' and 'awesome'. 'By now, it's just out there,' she said. 'What am I going to do? At least it's positive. Without that happening, how much could I get this recognition about my husband's kidney transplant?' There are more than 100,000 people waiting for a kidney transplant in the U.S., and of the 29,531 kidney transplants carried out last year, 23,715 were from living donors,\u00a0according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.", "reference": "Sam Griner was just 11 months old when his mother snapped him clenching his fist on the beach and posted the image online .\nYears later, she learned it had become the popular 'Success Kid' meme .\nSammy's father, Justin, has been on dialysis for six years and is in need of a kidney transplant so the family is now appealing for help .\nThey have set up a GoFundMe page to try to find him a kidney and to raise the $75,000 he will need for the procedure and medication .", "pred_summary": "Sammy Griner, eight, is using his online fame to help his father, Justin, who needs a kidney transplant.\nJustin, 39, discovered his kidneys were failing before the birth of their son.\nThe father is unable to work and never has energy, says his mother."}

{"article": "Oklahoma introduced a law allowing it to use nitrogen gas to kill death row prisoners if lethal injections aren't available. Governor Mary Fallin signed into law a bill approving nitrogen as an alternative method of death, giving Oklahoma four different ways to enact its death penalty. The method, which involves pumping a chamber full of nitrogen and leaving a prisoner's body to die from lack of oxygen, has been touted as 'foolproof' by supporters, in the wake of the embarrassingly botched lethal injections. Scroll down for video . Gas chamber: The state of Oklahoma has legalized killing death row in-mates with nitrogen. This 1999 file photo shows an Arizona correctional officer explaining his state's execution method . Executions in the state are currently on hold while the Supreme Court ponders whether the three-drug mix now favored by Oklahoma is constitutional. The pause follows an infamous execution last ear, which saw officials struggle to administer a the poison to an inmate, who writhed on the gurney in pain for some 43 minutes before finally dying. Nitrogen - which has never been used to execute humans before - is now the state's second choice. The new bill, effective from November 2015, moves the electric chair back from second preference to third, while firing squad becomes a distant fourth choice if all other methods are unavailable. Proponents tout that nitrogen killings will be 'fast and painless' for inmates - and also say the method is 'foolproof' as it requires no medical expertise or complex procedures. In a statement issued as the bill was signed, Fallin, a Republican, said: 'Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous. 'I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard.' The bill authored by Republican Rep. Mike Christian and Republican Sen. Anthony Sykes had passed the state House on an 85-10 vote and cleared the Senate on a 41-0 vote. Christian, a former Highway Patrol trooper, said: 'The process is fast and painless - it's foolproof.' Opponents say there's no way to know whether the method is painless and effective. 'It just hasn't been tried, so we don't know,' said Rep. Emily Virgin, a Democrat from Norman who opposes the death penalty. The changes come after a botched execution last year in which Oklahoma was using a new sedative as the first in a three-drug combination. State officials tried to halt the lethal injection after the inmate writhed on the gurney and moaned. He died 43 minutes after the process began. Adam Leathers, spokesman for the Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, released a statement blasting the new law. 'This is not only a grotesque waste of resources but indicative of a corrupt value system,' he said. 'It is sad to know that our State's collective bloodlust is so unabated that our leadership feels the need to spend resources to put a back up system into place so State sponsored murder can go on uninterrupted.' The problematic execution was blamed on a poorly placed intravenous line and prompted a lawsuit from Oklahoma death row inmates, who argue that the state's new drug combination presents a serious risk of pain and suffering. The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments later this month. The lack of readily-available lethal injection drugs - and problems with stocks the states do have - has vexed several other states. Utah brought back the firing squad earlier this year in response to a drugs shortage, while Tennessee reinstated the electric chair.", "reference": "Governor Mary Fallin signed bill allowing nitrogen execution into law .\nChamber is pumped full of gas, and body dies from lack of oxygen .\nMethod will become Oklahoma's second choice after lethal injection .\nSupreme Court is due to rule on whether current execution drugs are legal .\nIf gas execution is not available, state will use electric chair or firing squad .", "pred_summary": "Oklahoma introduces law allowing it to use nitrogen gas to kill death row prisoners if lethal injections aren't available.\nGovernor Mary Fallin signed into law a bill approving nitrogen as an alternative method of death."}
{"article": "Easter is over for the wild rabbits of greater Sydney as councils and parks prepare another attempt to kill them off with strategically placed carrots that have been laced with a deadly virus. Public land managers are desperate to reduce the most recent 'significantly rampant population' of the pest, which causes millions of dollars of major agricultural and environmental damage each year. 'This year, because of really high summer rainfall - which led to great food availability - there has been a big surge in the rabbit population in Sydney. They are really abundant,' Graham Wilson, the manager of biosecurity at Greater Sydney Local Land Services, told Daily Mail Australia. Feral rabbits, which are deemed a pest in NSW, are liekly to br targeted with the\u00a0Calicivirus, also known as Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), in May . It comes after over 30 government bodies scattered carrots laced with calicivirus around public areas in March . 'The way we introduce the calicivirus in rabbit populations is first we chop regular carrots up and distribute them to different areas and see if they are going to eat them. 'Then, the virus is produced in a laboratory with spreading agents and its mixed with carrots - so that it's coating the carrots - and then we take them and give them to councils to put out where they want.' While rabbits under one year old have a higher chance of surviving, about 70-100 per cent of rabbits die once infected with the calicivirus, also known as rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), which damages the animal's liver and gut and causes haemorrhaging and bleeding. The program has been implemented annually for the last nine years as a way of managing the pests and 'bringing the population back down again before damage becomes too severe,' Mr Wilson said. 'In other parts of NSW this virus spreads naturally, but you get bushland fragmented by houses and things in urban areas so we are just artificially introducing it into these places.' The feral animals compete with native wildlife for food and habitat and are believe to be responsible for the extinction of and population decline of a number of mammals. They also damage vegetation and prevent its regeneration by feasting on seedlings. About 30 public land managers and councils in Sydney, across 160 localities, scattered the infected vegetable in public areas in March, but a second smaller scale program is likely to be implemented in May across 10 areas as well as the Central Coast. 'It's just because in some areas the numbers have shown the rabbit populations haven't gone down as much as we'd like,' Mr WIlson said. Pet owners are being urged to vaccinate their domestic rabbits, but Mr Wilson assured the virus does not harm cats, dogs or humans. Rabbits were introduced to Australia by the British settlers in the First Fleet. They breed quickly, producing up to five litters of five young each year, and can be found right across Australia in various habitats . 'It's important that people who own pet rabbits vaccinate for calicivirus now to ensure that if their domestic rabbit comes in contact with the virus, which is mainly spread by contact between other rabbits and insects, they are immune.' While there are fears of immunity building in local populations, a test ahead of this year's program implementation found only 20 per cent of the local population was immune. 'This means you'd get about an 80 per cent population reduction and that makes a big difference in terms of the damage that they're doing,' Mr Wilson said.

The Nepali Pranksters were in the middle of shooting an episode for their hidden camera series when the magnitude-7.8 earthquake broke out. The team kept the camera rolling as they moved through the crowded streets, surveying destruction to homes and historic sites and capturing scenes of heroism and chaos. The Nepali Pranksters' videos show people's reactions to various \"pranks\" that challenge cultural norms. One video shows the pranksters walking up to strangers and taking their hands for a long, awkward, handshake; another shows them complimenting men and women on their clothes and appearance, with mixed results. For their next prank based on Nepal's ban on plastic bags, Ashish Prasai and Akash Sedai were in Jawalakhel, Sedai said in an email to CNN. The town, in Lalitpur District, is home to Nepal's famed Central Zoo. The camera was rolling when they felt the ground shaking around 11:55 a.m., Sedai said. People started screaming and crying and vehicles came to a standstill as a building collapsed in the background. But earthquakes are a fact of life in Nepal, and \"we were still thinking it was a just a simple earthquake,\" Sedai said. They kept the camera rolling for 18 minutes as they traversed the streets full of crying and shouting people. They found homes destroyed, where people were pulling survivors out from piles of rubble. They stopped and talked to motorists, urging them to keep the streets clear for emergency vehicles, Sedai said. They continued filming as they made their way to to the historic Dharahara tower and Basantapur Durbar Square, a UNESCO world heritage site, where people crawled among the ruins. By then, they realized their country was in a \"very bad condition,\" Sedai said. The Nepali Pranksters made it through the first day of the earthquake, as did their families, Sedai said. But with aftershocks and crumbling infrastructure still posing threats, safety is a temporary state of mind right now in Nepal. \"We are scared. ...

{"article": "Moscow (CNN)A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors\" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. \"There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't,\" a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. \"Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video).\" Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, \"I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about.\" The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that \"gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\" Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as \"a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia.\" Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. \"I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them,\" Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). \"We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone,\" he said before the 2014 Games. \"That's why you can feel safe and free here,\" he added, \"but please leave our children in peace.\" The rights group ILGA-Europe said in a May 2014 report that Russia was the worst place in Europe (out of 49 countries) for LGBTI people to live.

And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner.

'Plain and simple, if you f*** with me I'm going to break your leg before you even get a chance to run. Be honest. I don't screw around,' says the officer. Keeping calm, Mohamed's friend replies to the officer without missing a beat to say, 'Who said I was going to run?' Scroll down for video .

Put on the backfoot, the unidentified officer justifies his aggressive tone saying, 'I'm just giving you a heads up. I'm trying to be Officer Friendly right now.' According to Mohamed he and friends had just left the YMCa in south Minneapolis when the police officer pulled over their car.

{"article": "Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season - even though he may not be around to parade them. The interim Ibrox manager still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the current campaign after being lured back to his old club to kick-start their faltering promotion bid. So far, everything is going to plan with Gers second in the Scottish Championship table and destined for a semi-final play-off slot. Stuart McCall says he is already looking at transfer targets for next season, though he may not be at Rangers . But with 12 players out of contract, McCall knows the Light Blues will need to strengthen if they have any chance of keeping pace with rivals Celtic next season - if they go up - and is already piecing together a wish list of potential new arrivals. He said: 'I've been speaking to a lot of agents and putting things in place for if and when... Even if I'm not here, if I'm getting players put to me who would like to come to Rangers regardless of the manager, then we build a little portfolio of positions that we will be needing next year. 'It's not a case of us standing still and then thinking come June 1, 'Oh we need to get into action'. 'No, there are a lot of agents who come to us and we build a little dossier of players that as a staff, we think will be good for next season, regardless of what league we are in. 'It would be slightly naive [if we were not doing that]. If I'm in charge or not, I still want the club to do well and I will put my view across to the board on who I think should be coming into the club and who should be here.' McCall is compiling a dossier on targets as he looks to put the club in the best possible position . Rangers have operated a haphazard transfer policy since re-emerging from the embers of liquidation. The club's team of scouts were jettisoned under the disastrous Craig Whyte regime and former boss Ally McCoist was largely forced to turn to a list of former Ibrox servants he had personal knowledge of when trying to bolster his squad. But McCall revealed the club's new board are now starting the process of re-establishing their spying network - albeit on a smaller level than before. 'I think there has been discussions behind the scenes with different people,' said the former Motherwell boss. 'I don't think we are at the stage where we were 10 or 15 years ago where we were aiming to get into the Champions League and bringing players in for three and four million yet. 'I don't think Rangers will be at the stage yet next year where we need international scouts everywhere. Rangers have expanded their scouting network after a haphazard system over the past few years . 'But certainly a scouting network needs to be put in place. 'Having said that, I spoke to Craig Levein at Hearts and they do a lot of their scouting with [online service] Wyscout. When I brought Henrik Ojamaa in at Motherwell, that was after I'd seen a clip of him on YouTube. I sold him for \u00a3350,000 after signing him for nothing. That was great. 'So you can still do your own background work. Personally I would always like to see the player myself. I've only ever signed one player without watching him first and slightly regretted it. 'So yeah we need a scouting network but at this moment where Rangers are, not to the extent where we have scouts all over Europe.' McCall admitted he still does not know if he will rejoin Gordon Strachan's Scotland staff for the June 13 Euro 2016 qualifier with Ireland in Dublin. And he also confessed to uncertainties ahead of Saturday's match with Falkirk. McCall's side are still in line for promotion, sitting in the play-off positions in the Scottish Championship . Peter Houston's Bairns - five points behind fourth-placed Queen of the South with two games to play - need an unlikely series of results to make the play-offs but McCall says that raises more questions than answers. He said: 'Housty is a wily old fox who has done terrifically well in his career so I don't know what to expect. 'It will take a difficult set of results for them to get into the play-offs so I don't know if they will come here and think the pressure is off and play care free. 'They don't lose many goals so we may have to be patient through the 90 minutes. We have had a couple of decent results against them but they have capable players and we will need to be at our best.'", "reference": "Rangers are currently second in the Scottish Championship .\nStuart McCall's side are in pole position to go up via the play-offs .\nBut McCall is still not certain of his future at the club next season .\nRangers boss says he is still trying to build the squad for next year .\nRangers have begun to expand their scouting after several poor years .", "pred_summary": "Stuart McCall says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season.\nThe interim Ibrox manager still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the current campaign."}
{"article": "(CNN)What do Walmart, Target, and now the Koch Brothers have in common with the American Civil Liberties Union, ColorOfChange.org, and the Center for American Progress? All of them are adopting or advocating for hiring practices that open up work opportunities for people with convictions and leverage untapped potential in the labor market. Koch Industries' recent announcement that it will \"ban the box\" -- i.e., remove from its job applications the check-box that asks about convictions -- is a big step forward in the movement to break down barriers to employment for job-seekers with records. \"Ban the box\" doesn't prohibit background checks, it only postpones them until later in the hiring process. It's one item on a menu of fair-chance hiring reforms intended to ensure that job applicants are evaluated on their skills and qualifications first, rather than judged solely on past mistakes. These policies help reduce recidivism by making employment accessible to job-seekers who need a second chance, and they help break down the stigma of an arrest or conviction record. Two generations of the war on drugs, zero tolerance, and aggressive policing have left 70 million adults  with arrest or conviction records that undermine their ability to be considered for jobs, even as the job market has grown steadily. Millions of people are being left behind, and it's taking a toll on our economy: The reduced economic output of people with records cost our economy $57-$65 billion in 2008 alone. These criminal justice policies disproportionately impact African-Americans, who are incarcerated at a rate six times that of whites. The Department of Justice's recent investigation of the Ferguson Police Department, for example, shows the extent to which racism is perpetuated through police departments and the court system. That systemic racial disparity is then repeated throughout the economy, and the community is put at a severe disadvantage in the job market long after individuals have served their time. That's one reason the African-American unemployment rate is persistently twice that of whites. In a job market where employers that didn't previously do background checks now make them a routine part of hiring, qualified job-seekers are being screened out of the applicant pools for more and more jobs. Nearly one in three adults in America has an arrest or conviction history that will show up on a routine background check. Companies like Koch, Walmart, Target, and Bed Bath & Beyond recognize that this is a huge source of untapped talent, and that's why they've already banned the box on their job applications. These policies are also gaining traction with politicians across the political spectrum. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently signed executive orders removing the conviction question from initial applications for state employment. So far, 16 states and more than 100 cities and counties have adopted fair-chance hiring policies. Six of those states and the District of Columbia, plus 25 cities and counties, have applied their policies to government contractors or private employers as well. The Obama administration took an important step toward fairer and smarter federal hiring practices last year when it issued an executive order prohibiting contractors from discriminating against LGBT individuals. Banning the box and other common-sense hiring reforms would build on that progress and on the successful work of governors and the corporate sector. The administration should ensure that the federal government does not continue to erect unfair and unnecessary barriers to employment of people with records. Already, more than 200 organizations and prominent individuals have publicly urged the Obama administration to take these practical steps. If Koch Industries -- a major federal contractor -- can ban the box, there's no reason why other federal contractors cannot. Now it's time for President Obama to lead the way and embrace fair-chance hiring of people with records.", "reference": "Koch Brothers removing checkbox on criminal records from job applications .\nAuthors: Major companies are recognizing that those with criminal pasts can be productive workers .", "pred_summary": "Koch Industries' decision to remove conviction box on job applications is a big step forward, says Crystal Wright.\n70 million adults have arrest or conviction records that undermine their ability to be considered for jobs, Wright says."}

He nearly ran into three other drivers on the road, who were luckily able to swerve out of the way before crashing head-on with Freeh.

{"article": "When retired hairdresser Theodosia Aresti, 71, moved into a new-build flat in London five years ago, the frail pensioner thought she had found her dream home. But after a blocked pipe unleashed a 'tsunami of sewage' from the nine-storey building's 239 other flats into her apartment, her hopes of a contented retirement were ruined - and she says she now hopes to move. Mrs Aresti's nightmare began when she noticed a foul smell coming from her bathroom and discovered an unidentifiable brown substance bubbling up through the plughole in her bath. Scroll down for video . Traumatic: Theodosia Aresti was left devastated when her flat became flooded with raw sewage . 'I always keep my bath clean and I looked down and all I could see was this brown stuff coming out,' she remembers. 'It was bad. It was very bad. Within half an hour, it [the bath] was over half full.' But worse was to come. '10, 20 minutes later, the bath stopped filling  but the toilet, it made a terrific noise and then, when I looked, it was half full. 'Then it started filling up and filling up and filling up.

With raw sewage pouring into her flat, Mrs Aresti phoned her daughter Kiki and grandson Nicos and begged them to come to her aid.

Grandson Nicos Doukanaris was one of the first to come to his grandmother's aid and says the toilet resembled a 'volcano'. 'I came in through the front door and I could see the toilet,' he remembers. 'It was like a volcano, that's how bad it was. Just never ending. You could see she was visibly distraught.' But worse was to come. Despite the best efforts of the plumber, who spent four hours trying to stem the tide of sewage, the excrement was strewn all over the flat and had soaked into carpets. Worst of all was the mess in her bedroom which, according to daughter Kiki, both smelled 'foul' and 'was unhealthy' thanks to the sodden carpet.

{"article": "In an effort to counter rival Netflix's entry into the Australian market, cable TV's Foxtel will launch the third season of the critically acclaimed US women's prison drama Orange is the New Black by screening every episode in a full season marathon. A kink in the agreement with US studio Lionsgate - under which both Foxtel and rival Netflix share the rights - allows Foxtel to offer episodes of the series as an on-demand streaming title as well. Pedestrian.TV\u00a0website reports that the one lingering issue that adversely affects Netflix's operations in Australia is pre-existing distribution deals cut for its original shows in markets where, previously, it didn't exist. Taylor Schilling (left) is the main character in Netflix series Orange is the New Black . In Australia, this applies to the way Orange is the New Black was shown 'legally' in the country, leaving the door open for Foxtel to screen the series. Foxtel's priority distribution is the traditional one episode at a time airing method. And all episodes must air in this manner before they can offer the program as an on demand option. However, when the third season of the prison drama premieres on Netflix on June 12, Foxtel will also begin showing the entire season in one continuous marathon, beginning at the same time. The established prison drama is currently one of Netflix's flagship TV shows . Doing this means that when the marathon is completed around 14 or so hours later, Foxtel can then upload the entire season and offer the episodes on an on-demand basis for customers. The popular TV series is based on the book of the same name, by Piper Kerman, about a woman who is sent to prison for a crime she committed in her youth. It's a cast that includes Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew, Natasha Lyonne and Australian actress Yael Stone. The TV series is about a woman who is sent to prison for a crime she committed in her youth . The Sydney Morning Herald reports that former MTV Australia and Foxtel presenter Ruby Rose appears in the show's third season, reportedly as a prisoner who becomes in involved with both Piper (Schilling) and Alex (Laura Prepon). In the US, the series is one of the major titles for Netflix there, though the organisation recently clashed with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which controls the Emmy Awards, over whether the show is considered a comedy or a drama. The upshot is that Orange is the New Black must now compete as a drama at this year's Emmy Awards, a move which means the series will compete directly against Netflix's other flagship show House of Cards. In the US, the series is hugely popular and is one of the major titles for Netflix there .", "reference": "Foxtel to screen critically acclaimed US women's prison drama .\nCable TV organisation will screen every episode in a full season marathon .\nA kink in the agreement with US studio Lionsgate has created a loophole .\nIt\u00a0allows Foxtel to offer episodes of the series as an on-demand option too .\nFormer MTV Australia and Foxtel presenter Ruby Rose to appear in series .", "pred_summary": "Foxtel will launch the third season of the critically acclaimed U.S. prison drama Orange is the New Black in a full season marathon.\nThe cable TV network will also offer episodes of the series as an on-demand streaming title.\nA kink in the agreement with Lionsgate allows Foxtel to screen the series 'legally' in Australia."}
{"article": "(CNN)Beer and ice cream. It doesn't exactly spring to mind when you think of classic food pairings -- old friends such as bacon and eggs or steak and cabernet. But Colorado's New Belgium Brewery and the folks at Ben & Jerry's are teaming up on a beer inspired by ice cream -- salted caramel brownie ice cream, to be precise. \"At this time I can confirm that Ben & Jerry's and New Belgium are collaborating to raise awareness around issues we are passionate about, and that the results will be delicious,\" New Belgium's Director of Sustainability, Jenn Vervier, said in a statement. Both companies have a history of social activism, and the new project will be no different, they say. Their release doesn't say what the campaign will be all about, but Ben & Jerry's Senior Global Marketing Manager Jay Curley promises it will be \"impactful.\" \"We're big fans of New Belgium Brewery, their values, and their fun culture, and of course their beer,\" he said. \"We're excited for the campaign we've developed together.\" The companies will announce the details later this year, and the beer is set to hit shelves in the fall. New Belgium and Ben & Jerry's are both what are called \"B Corporations,\" a certification issued by the private non-profit B Labs to companies that meet its social, environmental, accountability and transparency standards. New Belgium supports sustainable agriculture, climate change and other initiatives, while Ben & Jerry's -- now a subsidiary of global conglomerate Unilever -- stays true to its hippie roots with support for environmental initiatives, fair trade efforts, marriage equality and more.

{"article": "Nigel Jackson, 59, a British expat accused of murdering his wife in Portugal has written a letter for jail explaining how he believes she died . A British expat accused of murdering his wife in Portugal has admitted burying her body in the garden but denies killing her, claiming she must have died during a bungled burglary. Nigel Jackson, 59, was arrested at his country home in Alvor, near Portimao in the Algarve, in January, after the body of his wife Brenda Davidson, 72, was found in a shallow grave outside. At the time Jackson claimed Mrs Davidson committed suicide after being diagnosed with ovarian and thyroid cancer. But after being shown evidence she was killed, he had now changed his story. In a letter from jail entitled 'LOVE, CARE DEVOTION AND BETRAYAL', seen by the Daily Mirror, Jackson said Mrs Davidson must have been killed by intruders. However, he sticks to the rest of his original story, saying he buried her in his garden with their beloved pets, which they called 'babies', because he thought it's what she would have wanted. He wrote: 'As I thought it was her choice I honoured her choice that night to bury her with our babies. 'I told everyone she had gone away...this was the only lie I told and I could not live with this lie so I went to the consulate and asked them to get the police.' He described the moment he found his wife's body in a pool of blood, claiming to have held the corpse for hours begging her to wake up before discovering the knife and a wound on her neck. Jackson is accused of murdering his wife at his home in Alvor, in the Algarve (pictured). At the time he denied causing her death, saying she had killed herself, but now says she died during a burglary . He also admits to moving his mistress of three years into the house as Mrs Davidson's body lay in the garden, but said the affair was no secret. He maintains that after her cancer diagnosis his wife had acknowledged that he still had needs to fulfill, and had given her blessing, provided he didn't 'bring it home'. Jackson said he moved his partner into the house in an attempt to get over his wife's death, adding: 'I was trying to move on but I could not do so.' Jackson was initially arrested in January this year after Mrs Davidson's son Dean became concerned about her whereabouts. According to neighbours, Jackson had initially said she had returned to the UK 'for treatment for a nasty cough.' But when she failed to return to their home  Jackson then alerted the authorities and told them he was 'dedicated himself to trying to find her.' However her son eventually contacted police and Jackson was arrested at their home and questioned by police for several hours. Mrs Davidson's body was found in the garden of her home in Alvor (pictured), buried in shallow grave, while Jackson had moved his mistress into the main house . It was then that he revealed the location of the body of Mrs Davidson, his wife of 27 years. Police believe she died last November before the body was wrapped in plastic sheeting and placed underneath a concrete slab and bricks in the garden. The couple moved to the Algarve around 10 years ago from their home in Rochester, Kent and had built up a close set of friends in the close-knit village. They had apparently got bored of their life in Kent and Mr Jackson, a former taxi driver, and his wife, a retired cleaner, moved to Portugal for a change of scene.

Her presence at the games did not go unnoticed. Wide receiver Dwayne Bowe would kiss her at every game, and former return specialist and wide receiver Dante Hall took off his coat and gave it to her,  Susan Johnson said. The last game the retired school bus driver saw was on November 30 when the Chiefs played the Denver Broncos. Last season, she attended every home game apart from three.

The 2012 Tour de France winner is quitting the team in order to ride for his own squad, 'Wiggins', before a return to the track ahead of the Rio Olympics, and wanted to sign off from what he called a 'golden era' with a win in one of the sport's most prestigious races. But it was not to be as Germany's John Degenkolb produced the perfect race to cross the line first at the end of a gruelling 151-mile trek which took in 27 tortuous cobbled spells. Bradley Wiggins sits on the floor after failing to win his final race with Team Sky in the Parsi-Roubaix . Wiggins left everything on the road as he attempted to bow out in glorious fashion, but was unable to hold on . German John Degenkolb celebrates as he crosses the line, winning the race ahead of Wiggins in 18th . Wiggins did his best, breaking away with 32 kilometres left to shake things up at the head of the peloton, while he also made a late push, but in the end he had to settle for a place down the line in 18th as Degenkolb took the glory. In the process he became the first rider to take first in the Milan San Remo and Paris-Roubaix in the same year since Sean Kelly back in 1986. One of the sport's classic races, the one-day slog did not fail to disappoint, but the drama almost got out of hand at one stage as some of the riders had a lucky escape when a train sped through the tracks they were due to cross. Some of the field slipped across despite the safety barriers being down, while others were held at the gate before being able to resume. Degenkolb celebrates his win alongside Zdenek Stybar (left) and Greg van Avermaet (right) Wiggins led a breakaway with 32 kilometres remaining, but was unable to maintain his lead to win . After that interlude the drama returned to the saddle, although Sky's in-form Geraint Thomas was unable to play a part. Amongst the early front-runners he was unseated when he ran into a curb, while he also suffered injuries on the way which eventually reduced him to a participant. For Wiggins it was always going to be a case of leaving nothing on the road ahead of his next phase, which is to include a ride at the Tour de Yorkshire. He first made himself known in the race when he moved to the head of the peloton with 45 kilometres to go and, with 32 remaining he ditched the pack in a bid to reel in the leaders. The peloton drew him back but his intent was clear and he held pace with them until Greg van Avermaet and Yves Lampaert went for it on their own. Luke Rowe (right) finished ahead of Wiggins in the end, coming in eighth, Team Sky's best performance . The pair were joined by Degenkolb and then Zdenek Stybar and at this point it was clear Wiggins' race was run. He found some extra power to go it alone again but the top prize was no longer on the table for him and he was amongst the rest as Degenkolb won the race in two laps of the Roubaix Velodrome.

Zhou Qunfei has shared her incredible 'rags to riches' life story with The People's Daily, after the self-made billionaire's company Lens Technology went public \u2013 making her wealthier than Richard Branson. The 45-year-old, whose company supplies protective window glass used in Apple devices, was born into extreme poverty in a village in rural China. Zhou Qunfei, 45, has been named China's richest woman after her company Lens Technology went public . Qunfei's ID badge from when she worked in a factory, making glass for watches. She would send her salary home to her father, who was nearly blinded in an industrial accident. Her mother died when she was five. Her mother died when she was just five years old, and her father was also made blind following an industrial accident. But he encouraged her to study hard to get ahead, and she left home as a teenager to work in a glass-processing factory in Shenzhen, where she was put to work shaping glass for watches. Fed up with her monotonous job, she handed in her resignation after three months \u2013 only for her bosses to promote her to a newly-created department. Qunfei said it was perhaps their surprise that a young girl from a rural village was able to write that made them take a chance on her. Bosses at the glass manufacturer where Qunfei started her working life promoted her to head up a new department within the factory after she handed in her notice, having been impressed by the quality of her letter . Qunfei set up Lens Technology when she was just 22 years old. She invented the scratch-resistant glass made by the company after she was inspired when watching how rain would fall on the surface of lotus leaves . 'Maybe it was because my resignation letter was well written and this attracted the attention of the factory supervisor', she said. 'The kept me on and gave me a promotion to head up my own newly created department.' She rose up the ranks to become the director of the whole manufacturing operation, before deciding to set up her own company, aged 22 years old in 1993. It was her rural background that also helped inspire the invention that would help Qunfei make billions. Qunfei says when she was a child she would watch the rain falling on lotus leaves \u2013 which later inspired her to create Lens Technology's patented, scratch-resistant coating used on a range of Apple devices. 'Droplets of water would roll around the surface of a lotus leaf and not leave any trace,' she said. 'If it wasn't for my primary school teacher reminding me to be observant I may not have had the inspiration to think of my invention.' Qunfei rented a three-bedroom 'villager apartment' close to Bao'an International Airport to launch her business, using savings of \u00a31,800 from overtime she had completed, as she sent her salary home to her father. In a bold move, she even passed on the contact details of her competitors to her customers in a bid to expand the size of the market, fearing her operation was too small for the amount of work available. Qunfei's company Lens Technology supplies Apple with its scratch-resistant glass. Shares in the company were worth 78 Yuan each on March 31, making the 590 million shares held by Qunfei worth $7.4 billion . Microsoft owner Bill Gates: \u00a345.5 billion .

{"article": "More than a dozen areas in the US have been shaken by small earthquakes triggered by oil and gas drilling, according to a government report released today. The man-made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states, including parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. Earthquakes, they said, were sometimes caused by fracking, in which large volumes of water, sand and chemicals are pumped into rock formations to free oil or gas. Scroll down for video . The study identified 17 areas in the central and eastern US with increased rates of induced seismicity. Since 2000, several of these areas have experienced high levels of seismicity. Researchers say there have been 'substantial increases since 2009 that continue today' They said the spike in seismic activity was largely down to the oil and gas industry injecting wastewater deep underground, which can activate dormant faults. Many studies have linked the rise in small quakes to the injection of wastewater into disposal wells, but the Geological Survey's report takes the first comprehensive look at where the man-made quakes are occurring. 'The hazard is high in these areas,' said Mark Petersen, who leads the agency's national mapping project. Oklahoma lately has been rocked by more magnitude-3 quakes than California, the most seismically active of the Lower 48 states, Petersen said. Oklahoma was not on scientists' radar until recently when the state experienced a spate of quakes, the largest registering a magnitude-5.6 in 2011. A 2014 United States National Seismic Hazard Maps with the areas most at risk shown in warmer colours. Recently,\u00a0man-made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states, including parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas . The cumulative number of earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.0 or larger in the central and eastern US, 1973-2014. The rate of earthquakes began to increase starting around 2009 and accelerated in 2013-2014 . Earlier this week, the Oklahoma Geological Survey acknowledged that it is very likely most of the recent shaking is from wastewater disposal. Many faults awakened by drilling have not moved in millions of years, Geological Survey geophysicist William Ellsworth said. 'They're ancient faults,' Ellsworth said. 'We don't always know where they are.' A message to the American Petroleum Institute was not immediately returned. The industry group has said efforts are made to map fault lines where drilling occurs. The fluid pressure in the pores and fractures of the rocks is called the 'pore pressure.' The pore pressure acts against the weight of the rock and the forces holding the rock together. If the pore pressures are low - especially compared to the forces holding the rock together - then only the imbalance of natural in situ earth stresses will cause an occasional earthquake. If, however, pore pressures increase, then it would take less of an imbalance of in situ stresses to cause an earthquake. This type of failure is called shear failure. Injecting fluids into the subsurface is one way of increasing the pore pressure and causing faults and fractures to 'fail' more easily. Earthquakes can be caused by injecting fluid into the subsurface or by extracting fluids at a rate that causes subsidence and slippage along planes of weakness in the Earth.

A group of experts met last year in Oklahoma to pinpoint seismic hotspots around the country caused by induced quakes. Scientists initially identified 14 regions affected by quakes linked to drilling. They later added three other high-risk areas - northern Oklahoma-southern Kansas; Greeley, Colorado; and Azle, Texas. The findings were released at a Seismological Society of America meeting in Pasadena, California.

{"article": "You can now book a London hotel stay by the number of hours you need the room for rather than by the number of nights you intend to stay. While booking hotels by the hour may have a somewhat seedy reputation, one company is allowing businessman and women and those who need a short rest to book well-known London hotels in three-hour blocks. Barcelona-based booking platform ByHours allows users to organise stays of three, six and 12 hours, and it has already got 25 hotels in the capital on board. You can enjoy the luxury of the Academy Hotel in London for a three-hour slot with ByHours.com . The App allows the user to select their area, and then their time slot, to be then shown a list of available hotels . The company's objective is to acquire more hotels in London during the next few months, and then start to work in other cities such as Berlin and Paris. In London, hotels that it has signed up include H10 Waterloo, The Kingsway Hall Hotel, Yotel Heathrow and Gatwick, Crowne Plaza London - The City, Academy Hotel, and Threadneedles, Marriott Autograph Collection. A spokesperson for the company told MailOnline Travel: 'In total, we work with 1,500 hotels in Spain and the UK and we have done more than 150,000 transactions in 2014, an increase of 150 per cent compared to the previous year. 'We work with hotels with three to five star rating, but 80 per cent of our hotels are four stars hotels. 'We have been focusing on hotels next to airports, train stations, city centers, convention areas and also hospitals, and now, we are scaling the business model in UK, with the same strategy.' Founder of ByHours.com Christian Rodriguez has been so successful in the Spanish market he has switched his focus to the UK . The Threadneedles Marriot could be a nice stopover for 12 hours, enough time for sleep and a shower . The main key of ByHours.com is that the platform benefits the customer, but also the hotelier. The customers have the flexibility, and they can book and pay for the time they use the room. But the hotels can sell the rooms more than once a day, and increase the revenue per available room. It's a totally complementary product, and with ByHours.com's tool, hotels can decide prices, hours of check-in, if they want to re-sell rooms (depending on their cleaning service), or availability for each week. The KIngsway Hall hotel has signed up to ByHours to offer a variation on the one-night stay . The four-star H10 London Waterloo is up for grabs to tourists visiting London who require less than a one-night stayover . The platform works real time, and the company have a 24/7 Customer Service for both the hoteliers and the customers. The founder of the company is 31-year-old Christian Rodriguez. He is a 'serial entrepreneur', he has founded six companies before ByHours.com, but this is the first one that is in the travel sector.

Bowyer, who has a lengthy injury list at his Championship club, wanted to include 21-year-old midfielder John O'Sullivan to face The Reds having recalled him from a loan spell with League One Barnsley last month. However, there was no dispensation because O'Sullivan was at Oakwell when the initial 0-0 draw between the teams was played at Anfield. Blackburn midfielder John O'Sullivan (right) is ineligible to play in their FA Cup fifth round replay vs Liverpool . Gary Bowyer says it 'doesn't make sense' that he can't use O'Sullivan, who's been recalled from Barnsley . Bowyer said: 'It will be a huge achievement to beat Liverpool in these circumstances. Because of the embargo (for breaching FPP rules) we are only allowed a squad of 24 players and have played 13 games in 43 days. 'So to be told we can't even play one of our own players because he was sent on on loan before the first game doesn't make sense to me. He's only been a Blackburn player for six years! 'We sent John away to help his development. He's back now, he'd be eligible for the semi-final if we get there, but not the quarter-final replay.' Ewood Park will have a capacity crowd for the first time since they were relegated from the Premier League in 2012 and Bowyer hopes the fans take a lead from Crystal Palace supporters.

Liverpool have had a torrid fortnight and arrive in Lancashire without suspended players Emre Can, Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel. In addition, a contract issue with Raheem Sterling has been a distraction while the club have lost their last two league games against Manchester United and Arsenal.

{"article": "A giant supervoid 1.8 billion light-years across may be responsible for a mysterious \u2018Cold Spot\u2019 in the universe. The theory was proposed by astronomers seeking to understand what is causing this larger-than-expected cold area. If confirmed, the supervoid would be the largest single structure ever found by humanity. Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for an anomaly in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe, shown bottom right. In 2004 astronomers first found the 'Cold Spot' - a region 20 per cent less dense than elsewhere - and may now have an explanation for its formation . The research, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, was carried out by the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Cold Spot was first discovered by astronomers in 2004 when they were examining a map of the radiation left over from the Big Bang - the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - made using Esa's Planck telescope. In the map, the universe is fairly evenly distributed, apart from in this one area. The huge unexpected region contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe and about 10,000 less galaxies. While other sparse regions have been discovered, nothing on this scale has been found before. \u2018Statistically, we are very confident that the supervoid is there,\u2019 Dr Andr\u00e1s Kov\u00e1cs, who was involved in the study, told MailOnline. He said that the supervoid appears to be \u2018roughly spherical\u2019, and it may even contain a \u2018significant substructure\u2019 at its centre; a void within a void. A supervoid is not empty, but rather a region of space that has less matter than other parts of the universe. For this reason it can \u2018sap\u2019 the energy of light that is passing through it. To explain how that works, imagine the void to be a hill. As light enters the void and travels towards its middle, it can be said to be climbing the hill, using up energy. Once it passes the centre, it would begin \u2018descending\u2019 the hill and regain the energy it expended to get there. But as the universe is expanding, by the time the light gets to the centre, its route out has become \u2018shallower\u2019 - or less dense. This means it cannot regain as much energy as it lost initially and leaves the void with less energy, therefore a longer wavelength, which corresponds to a colder temperature. The different is marginal - typically about 70 nano-Kelvins - but it is enough to stand out when the entire cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe is measured. The supervoid is thought to be causing a 'less-dense' region of the universe (illustration of empty space shown). At 1.8 billion light-years across it would be the biggest object ever found. But some 'exotic physics' is also needed to explain what's happening . The huge unexpected Cold Spot region, shown, contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe, and about 10,000 less galaxies.\u00a0While other sparse regions have been discovered, nothing on this scale has been found before . The original theory was that the Cold Spot originated from the Big Bang, and was a rare sign of 'exotic physics' that our current models of the universe could not explain. This new theory, however, suggests otherwise. Previous attempts to find a void at the distance of the Cold Spot were unsuccessful, but this latest study suggests it is actually a foreground object, three billion light-years from Earth. According to lead researcher Dr Istvan Szapudi, the object - if confirmed - would be \u2018the largest individual structure ever identified by humanity.\u2019 The team gathered data using Hawaii\u2019s Pan-Starrs1 (PS1) telescope on Haleakala, Maui, and Nasa\u2019s Wide Field Survey Explorer (Wise) satellite. The findings by the researchers were made using Nasa\u2019s orbiting Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) telescope (artist's illustration shown), which was launched on 14 December 2009, and Hawaii\u2019s Pan-Starrs1 (PS1) telescope on Haleakala, Maui . However, the supervoid can only account for about half of the entire Cold Spot, suggesting there might still be some exotic physics at play. The researchers note, though, that it is \u2018very unlikely\u2019 that the supervoid and the Cold Spot being in the same location are a coincidence. They are continuing to study the void with improved data from PS1, and from the Dark Energy Survey being conducted with the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.", "reference": "Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for a cosmic anomaly .\nThe object is thought to be causing a 'less-dense' region of the universe .\nAt 1.8 billion light-years across it would be the biggest object ever found .\nBut some 'exotic physics' is also needed to explain what's happening .", "pred_summary": "If confirmed it would be the largest individual structure ever identified by humanity.\nAstronomers first found the 'Cold Spot' in 2004 - and now have an explanation for its formation.\n region contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe."}

{"article": "Children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky, plastic Fisher-Price magnets that adorned fridges in family homes. The popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell. But for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters. The child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground . At least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. It is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time. A large amount of research, according to\u00a0Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors. This graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter . The latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green. Researchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters. They then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990. The results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set. Among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent. The colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row) Red bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent . Synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. Some people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga. There have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition. Reports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high-levels of creativity and intelligence. But among those born five years or more before it was manufactured, none of the colour-letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set. 'Analysis of the letter-colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus,' explained the paper. 'This indicates learning of letter-colour pairings from external [sources] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic, and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.' The authors did point out, however, that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role. They also said their findings don't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia. Instead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors .

{"article": "England must have played against worse teams than this St Kitts Invitational XI but, after a day that descended into near farce, it is difficult to think of any. Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts . Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England . The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap . Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out . Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead . For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the \u2018contest,\u2019 England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. Gary Ballance looked out of touch, the only real problem for England in a very comfortable match . Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances . When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side\u2019s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England\u2019s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner\u2019s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid\u2019s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week . Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days . The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England\u2019s unimaginative one-day thinking. England\u2019s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit. Truly, it is a sad state of affairs.", "reference": "England reduce Invitational XI to 24 for six after amassing lead of 320 .\nHosts hold out for a draw, but the game had descended into a farce .\nEngland will learn little from glorified net against woeful opposition .\nJames Tredwell out-bowls Adil Rashid in contest to be Test spinner .", "pred_summary": "England beat St Kitts in farcical warm-up game for first Test of Caribbean tour.\nBoth Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retire out as England close to winning on second day of two-day tour match.\nSt Kitts capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory.\nEngland may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests."}
{"article": "(CNN)James Best, best known for his portrayal of bumbling sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on TV's \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" died Monday after a brief illness. He was 88. Best died in hospice in Hickory, North Carolina, of complications from pneumonia, said Steve Latshaw, a longtime friend and Hollywood colleague. Although he'd been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood, Best didn't become famous until 1979, when \"The Dukes of Hazzard's\" cornpone charms began beaming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night. For seven seasons, Best's Rosco P. Coltrane chased the moonshine-running Duke boys back and forth across the back roads of fictitious Hazzard County, Georgia, although his \"hot pursuit\" usually ended with him crashing his patrol car. Although Rosco was slow-witted and corrupt, Best gave him a childlike enthusiasm that got laughs and made him endearing. His character became known for his distinctive \"kew-kew-kew\" chuckle and for goofy catchphrases such as \"cuff 'em and stuff 'em!\" upon making an arrest. Among the most popular shows on TV in the early '80s, \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies, an animated series and video games. Several of Best's \"Hazzard\" co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media. \"I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year,\" co-star John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, said on Twitter. \"Give Uncle Jesse my love when you see him dear friend.\" \"Jimmy Best was the most constantly creative person I have ever known,\" said Ben Jones, who played mechanic Cooter on the show, in a Facebook post. \"Every minute of his long life was spent acting, writing, producing, painting, teaching, fishing, or involved in another of his life's many passions.\" Born Jewel Guy on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best, who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana. Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, he accumulated scores of credits, playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such TV shows as \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Gunsmoke.\" He later appeared in a handful of Burt Reynolds' movies, including \"Hooper\" and \"The End.\" But Best will always be best known for his \"Hazzard\" role, which lives on in reruns. \"Jimmie was my teacher, mentor, close friend and collaborator for 26 years,\" Latshaw said. \"I directed two of his feature films, including the recent 'Return of the Killer Shrews,' a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier.\" People we've lost in 2015 .

Hubers, who was 21 at the time, claimed she was acting in self-defense because the young attorney was shoving and hitting her, but during an interview with police she was quoted as telling a detective she gave Posten 'the nose job he wanted.' Gun-toting girlfriend:\u00a0Shayna Hubers (left), 24, is on trial in the 2012 shooting death of her lawyer boyfriend, 29-year-old Ryan Poston .

On the first day of testimony Tuesday, jurors were shown a video of the defendant\u2019s interview with police following the slaying. 'He was screaming at me at the top of his lungs after he had thrown me around the room,' the woman told a detective sitting across from her, reported Cincinnati.com. \u2018I shot him enough times to kill him,\u2019 she said, \u2018so that he wouldn't suffer... He was laying there, twitching and making noises, and I shot him in the head. \u2018I was watching him die. it was painful to watch him die and to know that I had done that,' reported WCPO.

Troubled: Poston's family described his relationship with Hubers, left, as tumultuous and said that the 29-year-old was trying to end it . Prosecutors argued that the woman intentionally shot the attorney six times across a table, including once in the face, after Poston tried to end their relationship. Hubers' attorneys have maintained that their client shot Poston to protect herself. During questioning, Hubers explained to detectives that she went to Poston's home \u2018with the best intentions\u2019 not to kill him, but to convince him to work out their differences and mend their relationship. But when she arrived, Poston allegedly 'resorted to violence.' The woman said the lawyer made fun of her speaking voice, insulted her family, and physically assaulted her by pushing and dragging her around.

Gertrude Weaver, the world's oldest person, died at 116 on Monday in Camden, Arkansas . Weaver passed away from complications due to pneumonia, according to KATV. Kathy Langley, the center's administrator, said Weaver was enjoying the spotlight she received in the last week of her life, she told\u00a0Reuters. The staff read Weaver the many news articles written about her after she became the oldest person in the world. Weaver inherited the title last Wednesday, after the death of 117-year-old Misao Okawa in Japan, according to the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group. She attributed her long life to treating others well and eating her own cooking. 'I treat everyone the way I want to be treated,' she told reporters. Weaver, who received a letter from Obama on her 116th birthday, said she wanted to meet the president at her birthday party because she voted for him twice.

The actor bought the Aston Martin DB4 Cabriolet in 1962, shortly after winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Batiatus in Spartacus. It was one of the most luxurious cars of its day, costing \u00a34,000 and was delivered to him at a Swiss hotel at a time when the average house price in Britain was just \u00a32,500. The Aston Martin DB4 Cabriolet once belonged to actor Peter Ustinov and is expected to fetch \u00a31million when it goes up for auction at Bonhams. That's more than twice what it cost just four years ago . A collectors piece: These pictures show the prestigious Aston Martin logo on the bonnet, left, a trademark of the elite brand, and an absolutely spotless stylish leather trim, left, that once seated Peter Ustinov . The fast lane: The car cost \u00a34,000 in 1962 when the average house price in Britain was just \u00a32,500 . Quick sale: The 3.7-litre engine produced 240bhp. It went 0-60mph in nine seconds and had a top speed of 140mph. This was one of the fastest cars of the era so attracted interest from the rich and famous . Listed: The car is expected to attract \u00a31million - more than double the \u00a3431,200 it sold for four years ago . And while the average UK home is now \u00a3177,000, the value of Ustinov\u2019s Aston has rocketed even more and is expected to sell for around \u00a31 million next month. This is \u00a3570,000 MORE than the price paid for the Aston Martin when it was sold at a London auction in 2011. Engineers had fitted the car with a 3.7-litre engine developing around 240bhp, giving it a 0-60mph time of nine seconds and a top speed of 140mph.

It claimed to go from 0-100mph in just 21 seconds, making it a serious competitor to luxury European brands like Ferrari and Porsche .

{"article": "Cleared: 53-year-old Graeme Finlay, a former naval serviceman . A cruise ship passenger was yesterday cleared of beating up two elderly holidaymakers in a row over rudeness at the dinner table. Graeme Finlay, 53, went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner. After being cleared Finlay, an ex-naval serviceman from Glasgow, said: 'It's been hell. It's put me off boats forever.' The frail couple accused Finlay of an unprovoked attack that left the grandfather with a gash to his forehead and his wife with two fractured vertebrae. But the 16-stone gas worker insisted he only acted in self-defence when hit by Mr Phillips wielding his crutch and denied attacking his wife. The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. He told how he had put on five-stone by comfort eating since his arrest more than a year ago, and added: 'I'm really delighted with the verdicts and very, very relieved.' He said: 'It's been very stressful for the last year and a half. I go to church and I'm on the golf club committee, and it's been awful seeing my face in the news. 'I'm very sorry about everything that happened that night, I really am, but I told the truth in the court and I'm thankful that the jury believed me.' In his evidence, the defendant recalled how he was travelling alone on the Canary Islands cruise in January last year and felt shunned when he joined two couples \u2013 including Mr and Mrs Phillips \u2013 for dinner in the restaurant. After looking at the menu there was an 'awkward' silence and he moved to another table with a couple he had previously met. Both Finlay and the elderly couple spent the evening drinking separately and enjoying the musical entertainment. According to Finlay they later found themselves in a lift together and he rebuked the couple for their rudeness towards him at dinner. Finlay claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of hot chocolate at him, swore and struck him with his crutch. He told the court: 'I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself, I covered my face with my arms, I didn't want my eye poked out.'

{"article": "Keith Anderson attacked two men who he asked for a cigarette last year. He left one, an Army Lance Corporal, in a coma and severely brain damaged . A violent thug who ended a soldier's career with one punch because he wasn't given a cigarette has been jailed for seven years. Lance Corporal Albert Duffy had survived bomb blasts during a glittering military career which saw him complete three tours of war-ravaged Afghanistan. But after returning home to the UK, he was attacked at a bus stop by drink and drug-crazed Keith Anderson and left with severe brain damage. Just minutes before the attack, Anderson had punched another man, injuring him and leaving him incapable of work for a month. The 28-year-old thug 'bounced around, triumphantly like a boxer' after the assaults, a court heard this week. A judge was told the soldier had high hopes of progressing through the ranks, but is now unlikely to return to the military. Jailing Anderson for seven years at Teesside Crown Court this week, Recorder Patrick Palmer said: 'Albert Duffy was enjoying his career in the army. 'He was doing his bit for the United Kingdom and served abroad and served in combat and it seems highly unlikely he will return to his career. Your one punch destroyed that.' The court heard Anderson first attacked Adam Crosby at a bus stop in Hartlepool town centre on July 26 last year. He was angered that he only offered him the remainder of the cigarette he was smoking. Mr Crosby had to take a month off work at his family firm after he was left with a fractured cheek bone and damage to his teeth and nose. Anderson then walked to a nearby bus stop where L/Cpl Duffy was waiting and punched him to the ground after he failed to produce a cigarette. The soldier was left him slumped on the ground, bleeding from his ears and in a coma for 14 days. He sustained a fractured skull and needed two rounds of surgery after suffering haemorrhages, with part of his brain being removed. L/Cpl Duffy, from Darlington, County Durham, was a member of the 3 Rifles Infantry Battalion and had served in the Army for more than ten years, seeing colleagues killed and injured in Afghanistan. Teesside Crown Court heard\u00a0Lance Corporal Albert Duffy's military career had been ruined by the attack . He escaped with his life in 2009 after a vehicle he was in hit an improvised explosive device. He was blown 15 feet into the air, but suffered only a broken foot. Since the attack, he has gone from one of the fittest in his battalion to a man who struggles to put together sentences, the court heard. He also has hearing problems and has little short-term memory, the judge was told. His mother, Marie Briggs, says she no longer recognises him as the caring son once looked up to by his seven siblings and her three-step children. In a statement to the court, L/Cpl Duffy said: 'I don't know what I'll do if I don't have the Army in my life and I have fought for my country. 'I find it difficult to comprehend how my life has been ruined by a male from Hartlepool, who punched me for no reason.' Fellow-victim Mr Crosby told the court: 'I'm 25, I should be enjoying myself, but this attack has had a massive affect on me.' Robin Turton, prosecuting, said when Anderson was arrested on July 30, he asked police: 'Is that me you're looking for in the paper' after seeing headlines as officers appealed for help. He also asked about the condition of one of the victims, but made no comment when he was interviewed. L/Cpl Duffy and the other victim, Adam Crosby, were set upon at a bus stop in Hartlepool in July last year . Mr Crosby's blood was found on clothing seized from Anderson's home in Hartlepool. Anderson admitted grievous bodily harm against Mr Crosby and grievous bodily harm with intent for the attack on L/Cpl Duffy. He was sentenced to two years for the attack on Mr Crosby and seven for the assault on L/Clp Duffy to run concurrently. Neil Mullarkey, mitigating, said Anderson had started to tackle his drink problem since he was remanded in custody. He added: 'He is disgusted with himself and thinks about what he has done every day and is ashamed.' The court heard that Anderson already has 19 convictions for 39 offences, including punching and head butting two women in a takeaway and an assault in which he used a pool ball in a sock to attack a man in a pub. But Recorder Mr Palmer stopped short of classifying him as a 'dangerous offender', which would have allowed the judge to jail Anderson indefinitely.", "reference": "Soldier survived bomb blast in Afghanistan during 10-year Army career .\nHe was victim of unprovoked attack in town centre after returning to UK .\nPunch left him severely brain damaged and ruined his military career .\nAttacker - who has string of past convictions for violence - is jailed .", "pred_summary": "Keith Anderson attacked two men who he asked for a cigarette last year.\nHe left one, an Army Lance Corporal, in a coma and severely brain damaged.\nJust minutes before the attack, Anderson had punched another man, injuring him for a month."}
{"article": "Not a single Labour candidate questioned by a major polling company mentioned the deficit as being one of the biggest issues facing Britain. Ipsos Mori interviewed almost 100 candidates from the major parties, asking them what they thought the most important issues facing the country were. Not one Labour candidate listed the government spending or the deficit; compared to 35 per cent of Tory candidates. In an IpsosMori survey of people standing for election, not one of Ed Miliband's Labour candidates named the deficit as an important issue facing the country . 35 per cent of Tories mentioned the deficit, 5% of Lib Dems and 9 per cent of those surveyed standing for the Scottish National Party . Among the Liberal Democrats, 5 per cent mentioned the deficit as an issue; and even among the left-wing SNP, it was brought up by 9 per cent of candidates. The omission recalls Ed Miliband\u2019s embarrassing gaffe in which he completely forgot an entire passage about the deficit from his conference speech last year. The issue of Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU was also not mentioned by a single Labour candidate. Unlike David Cameron, Mr Miliband is not pledging any renegotiation of powers or a referendum on EU membership. Pollsters from Ipsos Mori asked 98 candidates to list what they thought were the biggest issues. They could mention anything they liked \u2013 there were no promptings. The top issue for all parties was the economy, mentioned by 85 per cent of Conservative and Lib Dem candidates but only 62 per cent of Labour ones. For Labour, the economy tied with health and the NHS as the main issue. It was mentioned by 62 per cent of candidates, compared with 65 per cent for the Lib Dems and 54 per cent of Tories. The next most important issues for Labour were \u2018inequality\u2019 (mentioned by 24 per cent of candidates), housing (21 per cent), and then jobs, immigration and education (all tied on 14 per cent). For Tory candidates, the third most important issue was spending and the deficit (35 per cent), jobs (31 per cent), education (27 per cent) and the relationship with the EU (19 per cent). No Conservative candidates mentioned inequality, housing or the impact of austerity. The economy and the NHS were the most frequently mentioned issues among the three main parties . Immigration, housing and international ties were the least likely to be mentioned by candidates . Austerity was the most important issue for the SNP (64 per cent), while surprisingly only 3 per cent of Labour candidates mentioned it. The survey, unveiled at a briefing by Ipsos Mori, was based on interviews with 98 candidates, including 26 Tories, 29 Labour and 20 Lib Dems. The briefing pointed out that the last time an opposition party was elected with an overall majority after just a single parliament out of office \u2013 the goal of Labour \u2013 was in 1931. It said that a leader had never been elected prime minister with such low ratings as Mr Miliband. But it also pointed out that the last time a governing party increased its votes hare after more than two years in office \u2013 the goal of Mr Cameron if the Tories are to govern alone \u2013 was 1955. Meanwhile Harriet Harman has admitted that drivers could be hit with a hike in fuel duty if Labour gets into power. The deputy Labour leader refused to rule out above inflation increases in taxes on fuel, alcohol, tobacco or air fares.

{"article": "The inquiry into the Iraq war, lead by Sir John Chilcot, began in 2009, stopped taking evidence in 2011, but will not report until 2016, a source said . The findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the Iraq war are unlikely to be unveiled this year. Further delays to Sir John Chilcot\u2019s inquiry into the war were reported by BBC\u2019s Newsnight and will fuel claims those criticised over the war are trying to bury bad news. It was initially thought it would be delayed until after the general election amid claims it could be damning for Labour. But it has now been suggested the findings of the inquiry, which began in 2009, will not be published until 2016. Newsnight\u2019s Diplomatic Editor, Mark Urban said he had been told the inquiry will be delayed until at least 2016. Tony Blair is expected to be come under intense scrutiny for sanctioning the ill-fated invasion. The former PM has denied that he was trying to obstruct the inquiry. Earlier this year, he apeared rattled when journalists put to him David Cameron\u2019s claim, that Labour had got the publication delayed. He pointed to a statement released by his office which said: \u2018It is not true to say that Tony Blair has caused the delay in the report\u2019s publication\u2019. Mr Blair is one of dozens who is believed to be criticised. Every one fingered has the right to respond to the dossier of evidence against them, often running to hundreds of pages. The inquiry - which stopped taking evidence in 2011 - was also set back by the death of one of its members and staff losses.

{"article": "Aliens are often portrayed as diminutive beings, but in \u2018reality\u2019 they could be much larger and heavier than science fiction films suggest. Scientist Fergus Simpson has calculated the minimum size needed for intelligent life to survive, based on the laws of conservation of energy seen on Earth. And from this, he calculates that if intelligent extraterrestrials exist they will typically weigh 650lbs (300kg) - the median weight of a polar bear. Aliens (illustrated with a stock image) are often portrayed as diminutive beings, but in \u2018reality\u2019 they could be much larger, one scientist claims. Fergus Simpson from University of Barcelona applied a mathematical formula to assume aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals  on Earth . Mr Simpson came to this conclusion by applying a mathematical formula that assumes aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals do on Earth. This means that larger animals need more resources to survive, so are less common than plentiful ants, for example. The cosmologist\u2019s calculations are also based on the idea that there\u2019s a minimum size needed for intelligent life, but don\u2019t factor in an alien planet\u2019s gravity. \u2018Throughout the animal kingdom, species which are physically larger invariably possess a lower population density, possibly due to their enhanced energy demands,\u2019 he wrote in a paper, published at\u00a0arXiv.org. He said there must be a minimum body size necessary for supporting intelligent life, based on the range of body sizes of intelligent animals such as apes and humans, found on Earth. \u2018As a result, we should expect humans to be physically smaller than most other advanced species.\u2019 '...we conclude that most species are expected to exceed 300kg in body mass. The median body mass is similar to that of a polar bear.' He claims that just as it is on Earth, there are probably more small animals than larger ones in the universe, but that the larger a planet or biosphere the more likely it is to have evolved an intelligent species. Mr Simpson said there must be a minimum size necessary for supporting intelligent life, based on the range of body sizes of intelligent animals such as apes and humans, found on Earth. And, if they exist, he believes intelligent aliens typically weigh more than 650 lbs (300kg) - around the size of a polar bear (stock image) His argument follows that if clever aliens are large, there may be fewer of them, as they will likely live in a society with low population densities to ensure they have the resources they need. Study claims aliens are larger than those portrayed in sci-fi (stock image). But the calculations don't take into account an alien planet\u2019s surface gravity . Commenting on the study, Duncan Forgan, a Research Fellow at the University of St Andrews, told NewsWeek:  \u2018I think the average size calculation is reasonable\u2019. Seth Shostak, a researcher at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, added that it is not the first time scientists have suggested that aliens may be large, because big animals tend to live longer. A longer lifespan makes creatures potentially more likely to develop knowledge and invent technology needed to make contact with humans one day. Mr Simpson continued: \u2018Higher intelligence enables the development of technologies which can sustain larger population sizes.\u2019 While the research has been described as interesting by Dr Shostak, he said \u2018there\u2019s no concrete data to work with\u2019 and that Earth is being used as a model to predict what life looks like elsewhere in the universe \u2013 but aliens may be completely different. He pointed out that it is humans\u2019 thumbs, bipedal stance and brains, rather than our bulk, that has enabled us to thrive on Earth, so body mass is only one indicator of intelligence. \u2018Polar bears are large but do not write great literature and build radio towers and a lot of that is probably because they are walking around on all fours,\u2019 he said. Mr Forgan also noted that the research doesn\u2019t take an alien planet\u2019s surface gravity into account. He explained that planets with stronger gravity might be expected to be home to smaller life forms than those with weaker gravity, which means that the calculation is incomplete.", "reference": "Fergus Simpson said aliens probably weigh more than 650 lbs (300kg)\nCalculations based on idea that there\u2019s a minimum size  for intelligent life .\nLarger aliens are more likely to live long enough to make advanced tech .\nEstimated size doesn't factor in evolution or an alien planet's gravity .", "pred_summary": "Aliens are often portrayed as diminutive beings, but in'reality' they could be much larger than science fiction films suggest."}
{"article": "(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma \u2014 two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: \"My vision is closing in now,\" she said. \"I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up.\" Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) \"It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of,\" explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. \"Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision,\" Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades\u2014even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin\u2014antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.", "reference": "Barr has macular degeneration and glaucoma, eye diseases that get progressively worse and can steal vision .\nThe risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60 .\nSun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration .", "pred_summary": "The comedian Roseanne Barr said her vision is worsening.\nMacular degeneration and glaucoma are two eye diseases that can steal vision.\nSome people are genetically predisposed to both.\nThere is no cure for either disease, but there are treatments."}

The mother-to-be, whose name is Injaz, was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born from a \u00a0surrogate mother. Injaz was six years old this week and is said to have conceived naturally. The world\u2019s first cloned camel is pregnant, scientists claim. The mother-to-be, whose name is Injaz, was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born by surrogate mother. Injaz is pictured here when she was just six days old . Dr Nisar Wani, scientific director of the Reproductive Biotechnology Centre in Nad Al Sheba, Dubai, told The National: \u2018We are very excited because Injaz is now pregnant and we expect to have a calf from her late this year. \u2018She has conceived in a natural way. This will prove cloned camels are fertile and can reproduce the same as naturally produced camels.\u2019 The birth of Injaz, whose name means 'achievement' in Arabic, caused great excitement in 2009 and scientists said that cloning would help to preserve the genetics of the camel population. Camels are a valuable commodity in the desert sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf, and are used for racing and transport. They can also produce low-fat milk and can make owners millions of dollars at camel beauty contests. Since Injaz was born, many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning, including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner. It's 19 years since the first mammal was cloned.\u00a0Dolly the sheep (pictured) was born in Edinburgh using DNA from an adult cell . Since Injaz was born, many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning, including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner, the BBC reported. It took five years of work before Injaz was cloned. She was born on April 8, 2009 weighing 66lbs (30kg), after an uncomplicated gestation of 378 days. The calf was created from cells harvested from the ovary of an adult camel. The cells were then planted into the egg of a surrogate mother. Injaz was confirmed as genetically identical to the camel the cells were taken from, according to United Arab Emirates newspapers at the time. The world's first mammal was cloned 19 years ago. Dolly the sheep was born in Edinburgh using DNA from an adult cell. Dolly was put down in 2003, after being diagnosed with lung disease, but since then, scientists have successfully cloned mice, cows, pigs and dogs as well as camels. Human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time, according to scientists. Researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in China that has introduced DNA changes to reproductive cells. Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren. Human embryos, like the one above, may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques . They say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications. They have described it as 'dangerous and ethically unacceptable'. However, others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers. Until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin, muscle, nerves, bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases. Modifying the DNA of human embryos so that DNA changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations. Such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the UK, but is permitted in the US and China. A number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos.", "reference": "Cloned camel was born in 2009 and called Inzaz, which means achievement .\nShe was cloned from ovarian cells and born by surrogate mother .\nInjaz is now six years old and is said to have\u00a0conceived\u00a0naturally .\nShe's expected to give birth late this year, proving cloned animals' fertility .", "pred_summary": "The mother-to-be was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009.\nSurrogate mother is said to have conceived naturally."}

Tim Howard is adamant the Europa League is not to blame for Everton's poor season in the Premier League . The Merseyside outfit played 10 games in Europe this season before being knocked out by Dynamo Kiev . Aaron Lennon scored for Everton at Swansea City but the game ended in a 1-1 draw at the Liberty Stadium . Swansea City (4-3-3): Fabianski 6.5; Rangel 6, Fernandez 6, Williams 6, Taylor 6; Ki 6.5, Cork 6.5, Shelvey 7.5 (Dyer 83mins); Sigurdsson 6, Gomis 6 (Emnes 17, 6.5), Routledge 6.5. Subs not used: Amat, Britton, Grimes, Tremmel, Fulton. Booked: Taylor, Emnes, Williams. Everton (4-2-3-1): Howard 6.5; Coleman 6, Stones 6, Jagielka 6.5, Baines 6.5; McCarthy 6.5, Barry 7; Lennon 6.5, Barkley 5.5 (Mirallas 86), Osman 6 (Pienaar 28, 6); Kone 5 (Naismith 76). Subs not used: Robles, Besic, Garbutt, Alcaraz. Booked: Kone, Howard, Lennon. Man of the match: Jonjo Shelvey. Referee: Michael Oliver 5. Attendance: 20,468. The demands of playing 10 games in the Europa League have certainly taken their toll but Howard rejected that theory, saying: \u2018That\u2019s something that\u2019s been talked about for the last five or 10 years but it\u2019s just a blanket statement people make. Champions League teams have to do the same thing. \u2018They play Wednesday and Saturday and it\u2019s tough but no-one blames Champions League football. Every football team does not have a god given right to be anywhere. \u2018We\u2019ve put in honest performances but things just haven\u2019t gone our way. We could sit here and make a list of a thousand different things but it\u2019s not the Europa League or anything else.\u2019 The perception that luck has not gone Everton\u2019s way extended to Saturday when Aaron Lennon\u2019s first-half strike was cancelled out by a Jonjo Shelvey penalty. Martinez was incensed by the award of a penalty though it appeared a reasonable decision. Neither side came out of the fixture unscathed, with Leon Osman of Everton and Swansea City\u2019s Bafetimbi Gomis due to have scans today on respective groin and hamstring injuries. Howard will not allow Europe to be an excuse for what could be Everton's worst season in nine years . Jonjo Shelvey of Swansea scores past Howard with a penalty to level the scores on Saturday afternoon . Swansea manager Garry Monk confirmed a striker is top of his summer wishlist after being left with no fit front men, while Everton, in the shorter-term, have been told to finish in the top half. Howard added: \u2018There\u2019s a points total we want to achieve and get ourselves in the top half of the table.\u2019 SUPER STAT: Everton named an unchanged team in the league for the first time since March 2014 against Fulham. Roberto Martinez will hope that after such a good campaign last time he does not get an unwanted record .", "reference": "Everton drew 1-1 with Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday .\nThey could finish Premier League bottom half for first time in nine years .\nTim Howard says his side's struggles aren't down to Europa League .\nToffees played 10 European games but Howard says form is down to luck .", "pred_summary": "Tim Howard is adamant the Europa League is not to blame for Everton's poor season.\nEverton played 10 games in Europe this season before being knocked out by Dynamo Kiev.\nAaron Lennon scored for Everton at Swansea City but the game ended in a 1-1 draw."}

Every adult in Britain would be paid \u00a372 a week under a commitment in the Green manifesto \u2013 but the party leader admitted her pledges could take decades to implement. Natalie Bennett said the so-called \u2018citizens income\u2019 \u2013 which critics say would cost \u00a3280billion \u2013 would take longer than five years to bring in, and could take even longer. She said another Green pledge \u2013 to dismantle the Armed Forces and use weapons factories to build wind turbines \u2013 was also a \u2018long-term aspiration\u2019. And the party\u2019s policy of leaving Nato and abandoning nuclear weapons was \u2018many decades into the future\u2019. The revelations came in another disappointing performance by Miss Bennett, when she was interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. In February she suffered what she called a \u2018brain fade\u2019 on LBC Radio when she forgot the details of her party\u2019s key housing policies. On Today, she was challenged about policies listed in the Green policy book, which is set by party members at the annual conference. One of these is the citizens\u2019 incomes, which would be given to everyone in Britain as a \u2018right of citizenship\u2019, regardless of wealth or whether they are seeking work. Miss Bennett, the Green Party leader in England and Wales, said the policy would take time to implement. She said: \u2018Let me say this very slowly \u2013 the commitment is in the manifesto. We don\u2019t think we can introduce it in the term of the next parliament; it\u2019s a big change. \u2018The Green Party has a long-term vision about what Britain should look like. I don\u2019t apologise for that. \u2018We are saying we need a Britain that\u2019s built on principles of politics; we need a different kind of politics and having that long-term vision, looking into the future and saying what should Britain look like in five, 10, 20 years\u2019 time is something that is very much central to Green Party politics.\u2019 Claiming the citizens\u2019 income was backed by an \u2018increasing number of economists\u2019, she said that as \u2018the sixth richest economy, we have to provide for everyone's basic needs and we have to do that within the limits of our one planet\u2019. \u2018The Citizens' Income, the commitment to that, is in this manifesto \u2013 but we've seen the difficulties that Iain Duncan Smith has got into in introducing Universal Credit, so we're saying it would take more than the term of one parliament to actually introduce this,\u2019 she said. Claiming the citizens\u2019 income was backed by an \u2018increasing number of economists\u2019, Ms Bennett said that as \u2018the sixth richest economy, we have to provide for everyone's basic needs and we have to do that within the limits of our one planet\u2019 After two-and-a-half years as Green party leader, Natalie Bennett would have liked to think she has made a name for\u00a0herself. But after another faltering media performance she suffered the indignity of being confused with her\u00a0predecessor. Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphreys ended the grilling saying: Caroline Lucas, thank you very much.' He quickly apologised for his gaffe. Ms Lucas was Green leader from 2008-12, but stood down to concentrate on being the party's first MP. Miss Bennett was also challenged over a pledge, contained in the same policy book, to dismantle the Armed Forces \u2013 saying it was a \u2018long-term\u2019 aspiration. She also said that abandoning nuclear weapons and leaving Nato was a \u2018long-term plan many decades into the future\u2019. The book also contains pledges to legalise the sex industry and drug use, decriminalise Al Qaeda membership and impose new taxes on pop music performances and large gifts. Miss Bennett said the Greens were now the third-largest party in England and Wales. \u2018We're larger than UKIP, we're larger than the Lib Dems,\u2019 she said. \u2018We have more than 58,000 members. \u2018We've had one Green MP, Caroline Lucas, who's had a huge impact as one MP in the Parliament. \u2018And we're now working very hard to send a strong group of Green MPs to Parliament who - given the electoral arithmetic - have a very good chance of being in a strong position to really influence the whole direction of the next government.\u2019 She said her party offered a \u2018genuine alternative\u2019 to the Conservatives' \u2018austerity heavy\u2019 and the Labour's \u2018austerity-lite\u2019.\u00a0The Green\u2019 manifesto will be launched next week.", "reference": "Green party leader flounders again in interview about her own policies .\nSet out plans for 'citizens income' paid to every adult in the country .\nForced to admit it would take 'decades' to implement expensive plan .\nEmbarrassment\u00a0at end of interview when she is called 'Caroline Lucas'", "pred_summary": "N Natalie Bennett said the so-called 'citizens' income' would take longer than five years to bring in."}
{"article": "Six Minnesota men have been charged with terrorism in a criminal complaint unsealed Monday, the latest Westerners accused of traveling or attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. The six, whom authorities described as friends who met secretly to plan their travels, are accused of conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The complaint says the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries from Minneapolis, San Diego or New York City, and lied to federal investigators when they were stopped. Scroll down for video . Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, and\u00a0Adnan Abdihamid Farah, both 19, and their four co-accused\u00a0have been described as close friends who met secretly to plan their travel to Syria . Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19, and the five other men arrested have been accused of being 'intent' on joining ISIS . Charged are Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21; Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Abdurahman Yasin Daud, 21; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20. 'These were focused men who were intent on joining a terrorist organization,' Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said at a news conference Monday. The six were arrested Sunday in Minneapolis and San Diego and are scheduled to make initial appearances in federal court on Monday. They are the latest people from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of Westerners by IS. Authorities said earlier that a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants in the past year, and at least one has died. Three of those charged in the newest complaint - Mohamed Farah, Abdurahman and Musse - were stopped at a New York City airport in November along with 19-year-old Hamza Ahmed, but they were not charged until now. Ahmed was indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to IS, and attempting to provide material support. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the FBI announced the arrest of six Somali-American men from Minnesota, accused of trying to join ISIS. Above, FBI Special Agent Richard R Thornton details the arrests at a press conference, with U.S. Attorney Andrew M Luger to the left . Despite being stopped already, Luger said, the three others continued to try to get to Syria to join IS 'by any means possible.' The complaint describes several interactions some of the men had with Abdi Nur, a Minnesota man charged previously with conspiracy to provide support to a terror organization. The complaint says Nur, 'from his locale in Syria, recruits individuals and provides assistance to those who want to leave Minnesota to fight abroad.' The complaint relies in part on material from a confidential informant who had himself conspired to join IS before he changed his mind and went to authorities. Some of the informant's conversations with the six men were recorded. The Minneapolis area is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants in the U.S. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have also traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the militant group al-Shabab. Omar's older brother, Ahmed Ali Omar, was among those who joined al-Shabab, leaving Minnesota in December 2007, according to the complaint. Ahmed Omar remains a fugitive. It also said when agents went to the younger Omar's house after he was stopped in San Diego in November, another brother, Mohamed Ali Omar, threatened them.", "reference": "The six Minnesota men were arrested Sunday on terrorism charges .\nSuspects Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20 arrested in Minnesota .\nMohamed Abdihamid Farah, 19, and\u00a0Abdurahman Yasin Daud, 21 were taken into custody in San Diego, California, after driving from Minnesota .\nThree of the men were stopped in November trying to fly out of the country, but were only charged this month .", "pred_summary": "Six Minnesota men charged with terrorism in criminal complaint unsealed Monday.\nAuthorities say the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries."}
{"article": "The cell phone ban at the Augusta National Golf Club has forced fans to dust off their often unloved and rarely used old cameras if they want to capture a photo of their heroes. Barred from bringing their cell phones on to the Georgia course, fans have adapted by going back to the future and using their pocket-sized digital cameras or their old 35mm bodies and lenses and re-learning how to use them. But a quick refresher course is all they're allowed. When play begins on Thursday, fans will have to put them back on the shelves. A Masters patron uses her camera to take photos of the action during the player practice rounds ahead of the 2015 Masters at Augusta National Golf Course in Augusta, Georgia, which starts on Thursday . 'Actually, the last time I had this out was Easter,' Wayne Watson said about the large black Nikon hanging around his neck. And the time before that? 'No idea,' he said. 'Probably the Easter before.' More than a few of the fans lugging around similar equipment were, like Watson \u2014 who made the two-hour drive from Macon \u2014 experiencing Augusta National in person for the first time. Most just planned to mosey around until something caught their fancy. Some had general targets in mind \u2014 a favorite player or two, the trio of back-nine holes reverentially dubbed 'Amen Corner,' or the gigantic manual scoreboard alongside the first fairway. Then there was the occasional experienced big-game hunter, decked out with camera bags and an array of lenses. 'I'm after Phil Mickelson,' said Kim McNeeley of nearby Aiken, South Carolina. 'I got a great shot of him the last time I was here \u2014 18 years ago. 'But there are plenty of guys more serious than I am,' she added. The cell phone ban at the Augusta National Golf Club has forced fans to dust off their often unloved and rarely used old cameras if they want to capture a photo of their heroes like Tiger Woods . 'I had to borrow this from a friend who just had a baby. A few minutes ago, I saw a guy actually loading film into his camera. Film. Now that's old school.' Stepping back in time produced more than a few comical moments. Parked in lawn chairs behind the first tee, two pals leaned in close as one tried to figure out how to take a 'selfie' with a point-and-shoot camera \u2014 never mind that the term hadn't even been coined when the camera was originally manufactured. Behind the seventh tee, Kevin Davis of Gibson City, Illinois, recounted the preparations he went through to make sure his 4-year-old digital camera was ready to roll. First, he had to find it \u2014 'It took me awhile to remember where I left it,' he said, finally remembering it was in a desk drawer \u2014 and then make sure it was charged. 'I've got a big camera, but I didn't want to lug that around,' Davis added. 'That's usually for family events.' Fans photograph Tiger Woods on their cell phones during a practice round for the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone Country Club South Course in Akron, Ohio, last July . But he might have had second thoughts when his twin 5-year-olds saw the camera and realized it wasn't a phone. 'They were scratching their heads,' he recalled. 'They said, 'Daddy, why is it so big?'' The fact that so many wound up opting for the big camera likely had to do with the number of serious hobbyists. While many planned to share their photos with friends on social media, a few planned to commemorate the trip with a photo album \u2014 talk about old-school \u2014 and in the case of Wes Rackley, make quality 8x10 framed prints and give them as presents. Few people, though, seemed as comfortable carrying around all the serious gear as Brett Pavel of Atlanta. He was at Augusta National for the 20th time \u2014 'I think that's right,' he said, 'because I've got at least 18 shirts \u2014 and said he has a camera around his neck at least once a week. 'My wife calls it my \"pacifier,\"' he laughed, 'because our youngest son plays competitive soccer and she says taking pictures is the only thing that keeps me from cussing and yelling at the refs and everybody else.'", "reference": "Fans on the Georgia course have adapted by going back to the future and using their pocket-sized digital or their old 35mm cameras .\nFans will have to put them back on the shelves when the action starts for real on Thursday at The Masters .", "pred_summary": "Masters fans have been forced to dust off their old cameras and re-learning how to use them.\nMany opted to take photos with their pocket-sized digital cameras or 35mm bodies and lenses.\nAugusta National bans cell phone usage ahead of the Masters, which starts Thursday."}

Launchbury has been sidelined since October because of a nerve problem caused by a bulging disc in his neck, but is close to regaining full fitness with the showdown against the Tigers pencilled in for his return. If the 24-year-old is given the all-clear to face the Tigers in a match that could be crucial to Wasps' play-off prospects, it will be his debut at the club's new home at the Ricoh Arena. Wasps lock Joe Launchbury is hopeful of making his comeback against Leicester Tigers on May 9 . 'I'm approaching six months out of the game, so it's been a long time. Now I'm approaching sort of the crunch time of the rehab.' Launchbury said. 'I'm building towards full contact training. A long injury, especially to the neck, is a gradual process to go through and you need to jump through a few hoops in terms of contact. 'Each stage I've taken on so far I've passed, so I'm really happy with where I am and hopefully over the next few weeks we can really ramp things up. 'I'm starting to feel really good and hopefully I'll hit my straps when I come back. 'It's always been hard to nail down a time to come back but given where I am now, I'm really setting my sights on Leicester at home in a few weeks' time. 'We're targeting that game, but it will only happen if everyone around me is 100 per cent sure that that's the right decision and my neck is in the best place it can be.' Launchbury (left) has been out since October due to a nerve problem caused by a bulging disc in his neck . Launchbury's absence has spanned nine missed Tests for England, comprising of the entire autumn schedule and the recent RBS 6 Nations. The Red Rose have missed his athleticism, work over the ball and tackle-count and if fit he is a certainty to make their World Cup squad with the global showpiece on home soil fuelling his determination to make a full recovery. 'There is an element of pressure - I really want to turn up to the training camps with a green ticket to my name as a fit player,' he said. 'I think that will be important heading into what's going to be a long and tough pre-season camp. 'I want to remind people what I can do on a pitch. Six months is a long time so hopefully I can get back out there and play well. The 24-year-old's potential return vs Leicester would be his debut at the club's new home at the Ricoh Arena . 'The World Cup has been the biggest carrot throughout this injury. It's been a long time, but I've had that every day in the back of my mind that I'm desperate to be there. 'Not many players get a chance to play in a home World Cup and hopefully I can get back fit and find the same form I had before my injury.' The lengthy lay-off has not come without its benefits, however, with Launchbury able to spend more time at home following the birth of his daughter Blythe. 'Within two weeks of having my operation it was the birth of my first child, so in that sense it's been brilliant to spend some time at home and really help my partner,' he said. 'It's been a great stage in my life for that and it's been great to be there for it.'

Hamilton spearheaded a Mercedes one-two at the Shanghai International Circuit, claiming his fourth Chinese Grand Prix victory and the 35th overall of his Formula One career. Rosberg, though, effectively accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference after the reigning champion slowed in the middle stint of the race to preserve his soft tyres. Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda (right) pictured by the circuit in his recognisable red cap . Nico Rosberg speaks with Lauda in the team garage... the German is expected to turn 'nasty' at some stage . That backed up Rosberg who had Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel closing in from behind, forcing him to bemoan the situation to the team over the radio, who responded by asking Hamilton to increase his pace. Rosberg made his feelings plain to Hamilton immediately afterwards, yet the 30-year-old was completely exonerated of any wrongdoing. As far as Mercedes non-executive chairman Lauda was concerned, the actions of Hamilton were that of a driver with a winning mentality. 'We were first and second and I don't care if there is a quarrel, as long as Vettel was third,' said Lauda. 'One thing is clear from my point of view, Lewis had pole position and controlled the race from the beginning to the end, therefore there is no need for a quarrel.' Asked whether Hamilton had the right to be selfish, Lauda replied: 'Sure, he will drive selfish. 'These guys... I call them egocentric b*******, and this is the only way to win a championship. It's the oldest thing. There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that's it.' Lewis Hamilton waves to the crowd from the podium as Rosberg reflects on finishing behind his team-mate . Hamilton and Rosberg spray champagne from the podium as Mercedes celebrate a one-two finish . Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team but Rosberg appears less pleased with second . Hamilton backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . Lauda rightly noted Rosberg opted not to attack Hamilton for the win, instead wanting to preserve his own tyres and hang on to second. The three-times champion, however, believes Rosberg will hit back at some stage, adding: 'Nico will calm himself down. 'For sure, when you are being beaten by your team-mate it hurts. When I was being beaten by (Alain) Prost all the time I was not happy. On the other hand Nico is a guy who comes back quickly, so thank God there is only one week to the next race (in Bahrain) so all this talk will stop quickly when they start driving again on Friday. 'Of course, Lewis bites, he has the talent to bite, but Nico is as nasty as he is if he sees the chance. Don't worry.' It means Rosberg could respond in Bahrain, the scene of their titanic on-track duel last season which sparked their at-times bitter rivalry which culminated in their collision in Belgium. For now, Hamilton holds a 13-point cushion to Vettel, with Rosberg a further four points adrift. Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . Rosberg accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference on Sunday . Overall, Hamilton said: 'I'm really happy. It was a great race and really positive to have a clean weekend throughout every session.' Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fourth ahead of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, with McLaren's Fernando Alonso 12th and Jenson Button 14th. Button had finished 13th, but was handed a five-second post-race penalty for an accident with Lotus' Pastor Maldonado that ended the Venezuelan's grand prix.

{"article": "Stuart McCall \u00a0watched Rangers bounce back to winning ways before warning his players they must show further improvement in the push for promotion. The Ibrox side recovered from their defeat against Queen of the South as two goals from Nicky Law and one each from Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic swamped Raith Rovers in a 4-0 victory. McCall, though, wasn\u2019t happy with some of lax moments within their performance and insisted that better will be needed for Wednesday night\u2019s trip to face a Livingston side fighting for survival. Nicky Law celebrates after putting his side 3-0 up as Rangers cruised to victory over Raith . That meeting with the Championship\u2019s bottom club is Rangers\u2019 game in hand over Hibernian, providing the chance to push three points clear in the battle for second place. \u2018It was okay,\u2019 reflected McCall on the victory over Rovers, who are locked in mid-table safety. \u2018There were some nice goals, although we were sloppy at times. \u2018For a little period in the second-half of 20 minutes, we went through the motions and we can\u2019t afford to do that. \u2018It was pleasing in a few senses with some nice goals, some decent football and a clean sheet. \u2018But we certainly know that Wednesday night will be a different challenge. I was at the Alloa versus Dumbarton game on Saturday and you could sense that Alloa had everything to play for and Dumbarton nothing bar pride, obviously. \u2018I thought the game today might pan out as it did, but Wednesday will be different with Livingston flying in terms of their recent results. \u2018There is no singing and dancing today. We have done OK. I still think that we\u2019ll need to be better and we can be better,\u2019 said McCall. Stuart McCall has warned Rangers to be on their guard against Livingston in midweek . The pick of the Rangers goals again came from Vuckic, who has scored in each of his last five Ibrox appearances. The Newcastle United loanee has netted seven times in 12 Rangers outings overall. \u2018We tried to swap it around by playing a diamond and by getting Haris into more space,\u2019 added McCall, who expects another of the loanees, Shane Ferguson, to begin training with Rangers today. \u2018But he still tends to head for the right-hand side, which is his favourite. \u2018Every time he cuts in onto his left, you expect the net to bulge. \u2018We had good footballers in there with him, Nicky Law, Dean Shiels and Andrew Murdoch, who I thought was terrific again. \u2018I said from day one that Haris has got fantastic ability. \u2018Obviously, he has got fitter having played more games now, and his match fitness is now looking strong at the end of games where he was flagging after 50 or 60 minutes earlier. \u2018That\u2019s just having more time on the park. He is important to us and he is a goal threat.\u2019 Nicky Clark (left) heads it home to give Rangers an early lead . Raith Rovers manager Grant Murray feels Rangers have improved under McCall, but he also believes that whichever Championship side comes through the play-offs will face a difficult task to clear the final promotion hurdle. \u2018They still have to go and play a Premier League team and there is a good chance that that team will have a winning mentality,\u2019 said Murray. \u2018People are talking about Ross County or Motherwell - well it won\u2019t be an easy task going to these kind of places. \u2018I think everyone is talking about how Rangers have picked up now and they look like a strong team who will finish second. \u2018Hibs have had a fantastic season, too, in terms of the attacking football they play, but I think Queen of the South are also keeping themselves in there. \u2018We knew Rangers would come at us after losing on Thursday and we knew it would be difficult. It is difficult coming to places like this and you have to stand up and have the right mentality.

{"article": "The U.S. Supreme Court's . arguments on Tuesday over same-sex marriage will cap more than . two decades of litigation and a transformation in public . attitudes. Based on the court's actions during the past two years, a . sense of inevitability is in the air: That a majority is on the . verge of declaring gay marriage legal nationwide. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's pivotal member on gay . rights, has been marching in this direction with opinions dating . to 1996. In his most recent gay rights decision for the court in . 2013, rejecting a legal definition of marriage limited to a man . and woman for purposes of federal benefits, Kennedy deplored . that U.S. law for making gay marriages 'unequal.' Scroll down for video . A moment in history: People line up outside the Supreme Court in Washington April 26 ahead of Tuesday's arguments focusing on gay marriage . That 5-4 decision did not address a constitutional right to . same-sex marriage, but lower court judges interpreted the ruling . as an endorsement of it and began invalidating state bans. When states appealed rulings striking down their same-sex . marriage prohibitions, the Supreme Court declined to intervene, . most notably in October 2014 when it denied appeals in seven . cases on a single day. Instead, the nine justices are hearing in Tuesday's oral . arguments an appeal of the sole decision from a regional U.S. appeals court that went the opposite way. Last November, the . Cincinnati-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit . upheld gay marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and . Tennessee. With 37 of the 50 states now permitting gay marriage, many . because of judicial orders, it seems unlikely the country's . highest court would reverse course. Public opinion polls over . the last decade have shown large increases in support for gay . marriage. A ruling is due by the end of June. Yet some questions remain. How much will Kennedy, a member of the court's five-man . conservative bloc who often casts decisive votes in close cases, . show his hand in the 2-1/2 hours of oral arguments? Will he . reveal a clear view that the Constitution gives gay people a . right to marry or will he voice concerns for state interests in . controlling marriage laws? An element of uncertainty hovers over Chief Justice John . Roberts, who broke with the other court conservatives and cast . the deciding vote upholding President Barack Obama's healthcare . law in 2012. Roberts voted against gay rights in the 2013 . ruling. But he separated himself from the most conservative . dissenters and declined to declare outright that states may ban . gay marriage. He has demonstrated apprehension about the reputation of the . court that, by virtue of his service as chief justice, . informally bears his name. In his opinions, he has sometimes . tried to lower tensions in controversial cases and reassure . people that the court is aligning with precedent and public . expectations.

Going through a split from her husband, Nickelback front man Chad Kroeger? Focus on the mystery intensified in December after a fan Twitter account posted a direct message from Lavigne when she solicited prayers, saying she was \"having some health issues.\" Now the Canadian singer has revealed to People magazine that she was bedridden for five months after contracting Lyme disease. \"I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk, and I couldn't move,\" she told the magazine. \"I thought I was dying.\" Lyme disease: What you should know . Lavigne believes that she was bitten by a tick last spring. What followed was months of lightheadedness and lethargy that doctors were initially unable to diagnose. The 30-year-old performer said she recuperated in her Ontario home, where her husband would use tour breaks to care for her and her mother moved in to assist. \"There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand,\" she told People. \"It felt like having all your life sucked out of you.\" Opinion: Why you should be afraid of Lyme disease . After her direct message about her health went viral, Lavigne was inundated with concern from fans. \"The get-well messages and videos they sent touched me so deeply,\" she said. Now declaring herself \"80 percent better,\" Lavigne is releasing a new single this month to support the 2015 Special Olympics and says that being ill was a \"wake-up call\" that has given her a new perspective. \"I really just want to enjoy life from here on out,\" she said.", "reference": "The singer had been off the scene for a while .\nShe says she was bedridden for months .\nLavigne was sometimes too weak to shower .", "pred_summary": "The singer was bedridden for five months after contracting Lyme disease.\nShe says being ill was a \"wake-up call\" that has given her a new perspective."}

The match was being held as part of a lavish series of events celebrating the 103rd birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the young leader's grandfather, which falls on Wednesday. North Korea designates the 'Day of the Sun' as a rare two-day national holiday, with art performances, exhibitions and sporting events, and pilgrimages to the late leader's birthplace in Pyongyang. A former member of the North's Unhasu Orchestra, Ri was last seen in public in December 2014, when she and her husband attended a ceremony to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-Il.

Kim Il-Sung led North Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death on July 8, 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-Il, who also ruled until his death in December 2011 when power was transferred to his son and current leader Kim Jong-un.

The North announced in February that the April 12 marathon would only be open to domestic runners this year, because of lingering concerns over the Ebola epidemic in west Africa.

Her daily donkey-milk baths, which she believed had anti-ageing and skin smoothing properties thanks to the alpha hydroxy acids, apparently required over 700 donkeys to accomplish.

{"article": "A drug company has been accused of trying to block trials aimed at promoting a \u2018cheap, safe and effective\u2019 treatment for sight loss on the NHS. It has \u2018bullied\u2019 experts who have tried to prove that a cancer drug can be used to treat one of the most common forms of blindness, according to the BMJ. The respected medical journal says Avastin is just as effective at tackling wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as the current treatment, Lucentis. Drug company Novartis has been accused of trying to block trials aimed at promoting a \u2018cheap, safe and effective\u2019 treatment for sight loss which would save the NHS around \u00a3102million a year . Avastin is much cheaper and it is estimated that widespread use of the drug would save the NHS around \u00a3102million a year. But the BMJ says the drug company has consistently tried to \u2018undermine and divert attention\u2019 from trials to prove Avastin works \u2013 even turning to the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) for help. Wet AMD is the most common form of blindness in people over 50. Findings from clinical trials suggest Avastin is safe and effective in treating AMD \u2013 but it costs \u00a370 per treatment compared with \u00a3740 for an injection of Lucentis. Novartis, which markets Lucentis in the UK, has allegedly tried to \u2018do everything\u2019 it can to stop trials of the cancer drug. The BMJ obtained emails under a freedom of information request showing that clinicians with ties to Novartis had urged some primary care trusts to pull out of one Avastin trial, while efforts were made to \u2018derail\u2019 a second publicly funded UK trial. The trial\u2019s chief investigator, Alex Foss, a consultant ophthalmologist at Queen\u2019s Medical Centre, Nottingham, told the BMJ how, during the planning stage, a Novartis representative tried to divert him to Novartis funded work \u2013 with the prospect of future funds for personal research projects. The BMJ says drug company Novartis (pictured) has consistently tried to \u2018undermine and divert attention\u2019 from trials to prove Avastin works \u2013 even turning to the Royal National Institute of Blind People for help . Dr Foss said: \u2018He stated Novartis would do everything to stop the trial and challenge its ethics. He stated the challenge would not come from Novartis itself but from the RNIB.\u2019 Dr Foss said the Novartis representative, whom he met in a pub, had funded an RNIB campaign to get Lucentis made available to patients before approval by the NHS watchdog. BMJ editor in chief, Dr Fiona Godlee, said the new evidence \u2018raises questions about the legal and regulatory positions that have skewed clinical practice, fuelled NHS drug costs, and left doctors confused about what they can and can\u2019t prescribe\u2019. Loss of vision that develops with age, known as age-related macular degeneration, is the most common cause of blindness in people over 50. Most AMD starts as a \u2018dry\u2019 form but for one in five it progresses to the more severe, but treatable form of wet AMD. AMD robs people of the central vision necessary for reading, driving or simply recognising people\u2019s faces. Wet AMD is caused by abnormal growth of blood vessels around the eye. It can be treated by using drugs to stop the growth of a natural protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, which prevents the formation of new blood vessels. Research suggests the number of Britons with AMD will rise by a quarter in the next decade, up from 600,000 at present to 750,000. She said: \u2018Doctors and academics have carried out clinical trials despite threats and intimidation \u2013 and doctors leaders should follow suit and not allow themselves to be bullied either. \u2018Doctors\u2019 leaders also need to sort out the web of misinformation about drug prescribing that has been generated behind closed doors and is costing the NHS hundreds of millions of pounds a year by scaring doctors from using cheap and effective medicines.\u2019 The RNIB told the BMJ that last year only 0.3 per cent of its total income was from drug companies. A spokesman said: \u2018We stand by our decision to challenge the trial, which was motivated entirely by our aim to protect patients\u2019 right to timely sight-saving treatment.\u2019 A Novartis spokesman said: \u2018Novartis does not tolerate unethical behaviour by its associates in any country, and has a comprehensive compliance programme in place to help ensure that our associates comply with the company\u2019s code of conduct and all applicable laws. \u2018Novartis strongly believes that patients have the right to the highest standard of care and that this right should be defended to promote safety and quality.\u2019", "reference": "Drug company accused of trying to block trials aimed at promoting a 'cheap, safe and effective' treatment for sight loss on the NHS .\nIt 'bullied' experts who tried to prove drug can be used to treat blindness .\nAvastin is effective at tackling wet age-related macular degeneration .\nCheaper than the current treatment it would save NHS \u00a3102million a year .", "pred_summary": "Drug company Novartis accused of trying to block trials aimed at promoting 'cheap, safe and effective' treatment.\nWet age-related macular degeneration is most common form of blindness in people over 50.\nAvastin is much cheaper than Lucentis and could save the NHS \u00a3102million a year."}

Aimee West, 24, is said to be in a relationship with Major Paul Draper \u2013 a former comrade of the murdered soldier. Just two years after Fusilier Rigby was hacked to death in Woolwich, south-east London, she is said to have formed a close bond with Major Draper, who was a mourner at her fiance's funeral. Scroll down for video . Lee Rigby's fianc\u00e9e Aimee West (left) has found happiness with a friend of the murdered soldier, Major Paul Draper (right) Major Draper's ex-wife, Jane \u2013 whom he left for another woman in 2002 \u2013 said she was not surprised by his new relationship. Speaking from her home in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, yesterday, she said their three children were aware he was dating Miss West. 'He left me for a girl in the [Army] Cadets,' Mrs Draper said. 'He then was seeing another girl who he met in the Cadets, who he was with for around ten years.' It was this relationship, not his marriage, that Major Draper ended before spending time with Miss West. His ex-wife added: 'He's gone out with two other girls from the Cadets and one was 20 years younger.' Aimee West, 24, was devastated when her husband-to-be Fusilier Rigby (pictured) was hacked to death in the street in Woolwich, south east London, two years ago . According to reports, Miss West and Major Draper have been on several dates in the past few months. The 51-year-old, a decorated member of the Middlesex and North West Army Cadet Force, told the Sunday Mirror: 'I like to see Aimee. We are very good friends and we enjoy each other's company.' A source told the paper it was 'common knowledge they're dating', adding: 'If anyone deserves to be happy, it's Aimee. She's had a dreadful time. 'She'll never forget Lee \u2013 he was so important to her \u2013 but everyone wants her to be happy. Paul is a lot older than Aimee but he's been there for her since Lee died.' Major Draper separated from his latest partner, Priscilla, last November. He and Miss West have since attended a number of Cadet functions together and last month he comforted her at a St Paul's Cathedral service to honour fallen soldiers in Afghanistan. Miss West met Fusilier Rigby at an Army Cadets training camp in Wales in August 2012 and a year later they were engaged. Pictured from left, Aimee West, Lee Rigby's sister Sara McClure and his mother Lyn Rigby at the Old Bailey . Remembering him last year, she said: 'As soon as he turned up, everyone knew he was there because he was energetic and fast-paced, and like nobody else I ever met.' Miss West was 3,500 miles away at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan when she learned her fiance had been killed in front of horrified onlookers near Woolwich Barracks. British-born Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, mowed down Fusilier Rigby in a car as he was walking towards the barracks in a Help For Heroes hoodie, before hacking him to death with knives. They claimed the heinous act on May 22, 2013, was revenge for the killing of Muslims by British armed forces. They were both jailed for life. After the sentencing, Miss West said: 'I hope that this is the last we will hear from them both, so that I can focus on rebuilding my life and keeping Lee's memory alive.' Miss West met Fusilier Rigby at an Army Cadets training camp in Wales and became engaged in 2013 . Following Fusilier Rigby's death, Miss West quit the Army and has gone back to university, where she is studying to be a lawyer. She set up the Lee Rigby Fund as part of the Soldiers' Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association \u2013 and is set to run the London Marathon to raise money for the charity later this month.

{"article": "Arrogant: Violent robber Lynch posing for a jail selfie . Staring cockily at the camera, violent robber Craig 'Lazie' Lynch shows off his toned physique in a series of audacious self-portraits taken in his prison cell \u2013 from where he is said to be earning a fortune by running illegal websites. Lynch is serving nine years for a series of violent gang robberies, including one in which a knife was held to a terrified father's throat in front of his family. Use of computers, social media and mobile phones is strictly forbidden behind bars. Yet, as this picture and his posts show, Lynch has been free to run a sneering Facebook site from his cell in Bedford Prison. And, according to a former friend, he is using it to make huge profits from websites selling legal highs. The friend, now disgusted with Lynch and the 'lax attitude' of the prison authorities, told The Mail on Sunday the bearded criminal has become a 'self-made millionaire earning so much tax-free money behind bars he has invested in properties in Cyprus, Ireland and Spain and a fleet of luxury cars'. Lynch, 34, is in constant communication with more than 400 'friends', poking fun at British justice and bragging about using an iPhone and a Samsung Galaxy. He updates social media feeds with 'selfies' and photos of takeaway meals \u2013 and reports how he has had a tattoo, drinks vodka, plays online games and has a personal gym trainer. 'He should be in prison as a punishment, not living it up,' said the former friend. 'He's arrogant, resourceful, and owns properties overseas and UK-based businesses. 'Incredibly, this is all through crime, run on Facebook while in prison.' This is not the first time Lynch \u2013 who has appeared in court 22 times for 66 offences \u2013 has used Facebook to taunt the authorities. In 2009 he used the site to goad police after vanishing from Hollesley Bay Prison, Suffolk, where he was serving a seven-year sentence for aggravated burglary. He was recaptured in January 2010. He was later released but in August last year he was found guilty of robbery and sent back to prison \u2013 and once again began posting from his cell on Facebook. Claiming he studies 'Advanced criminology at University of Crime', he even uses Facebook to advertise for people to work for him. In one post he offers: '\u00a3250 an hour, three hours a week. Only the sinister to apply. Easy work. No crime.' Contraband items are often smuggled into jails or thrown over the walls. The former friend also believes Lynch was behind an attempt in March to fly contraband goods into the prison using a drone, which was discovered in netting above the perimeter wall \u2013 as reported in The Mail on Sunday. A parcel attached to the drone contained drugs, a phone, a blade and screwdrivers. The source said: 'Lynch posted a cutting from a newspaper report about the find and wrote, 'No comment\u2026' It was his way of bragging he was behind it. 'He is making a fortune selling contraband inside, such as phones and legal highs, as well as his earnings from the websites, all tax-free. 'Yet the authorities seem to look the other way.' The Ministry of Justice said last night that any prisoners using mobile phones would face disciplinary action.

{"article": "Kent Sprouse was put to death by lethal injection Thursday night in Texas. Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. He died 22 minutes after being injected and is now the fifth inmate to be executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row:\u00a0Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . In his final statement shortly before he was killed, Sprouse said; 'I would like to apologize to the Moreno family and the Steinfeldt family for all of the trouble I have caused them. 'I would like to apologize to my family for all of the trouble that I have caused them. I would also like to thank my family for all of their support. I guess that\u2019s it.' Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) and customer \u00a0Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said that a recent purchase of pentobarbital meant they had enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.", "reference": "Kent Sprouse, 42, died of a\u00a0lethal\u00a0injection Thursday in Texas .\nIt took 22 minutes for Sprouse to die after being injected .\nIn 2002 he gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas and a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38 .\nSprouse was high on meth, but his insanity defense was rejected and he\u00a0was sentenced to death in 2004 .\n'I would like to apologize to the Moreno family and the Steinfeldt family for all of the trouble I have caused them,' said Sprouse in his final statement .", "pred_summary": "Kent Sprouse, 42, executed by lethal injection in Texas.\nHe is now the fifth inmate to be executed in the nation's most active death penalty state.\nU.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review his case."}
{"article": "(CNN)A dress worn by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara in \"Gone With the Wind\" has fetched $137,000 at an auction. That's a pretty healthy profit for the collector who bought the outfit decades ago for a mere $20 as it was on the verge of being tossed out. The outfit, a gray two-piece ensemble, was sold at an auction in Beverly Hills, California, on Saturday, according to Heritage Auctions. It was the most sought after item among roughly 150 pieces of \"Gone With the Wind\" memorabilia on sale in the auction. They come from the huge collection amassed by James Tumblin, who used to work at Universal Studios. Tumblin said he came across the Scarlett O'Hara dress in the early 1960s while doing some research at a costume company. \"I saw this dress on the floor and a docent told me not to bother to pick it up, because they were throwing it away,\" he said, according to The Telegraph. \"I asked if he would sell it to me,\" he said. \"I had noticed there was a printed label saying Selznick International Pictures and 'Scarlett production dress' was written in ink.\" From that savvy purchase, his \"Gone With the Wind\" collection snowballed. Other standout items include a straw hat worn by Leigh in a number of scenes in the movie and a gray wool suit worn by Clark Gable as his character, Rhett Butler, kicks down the door of Scarlett O'Hara's boudoir. The dress -- a jacket and full skirt ensemble -- was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Butler and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray. Over the years, it's faded to light gray. But that didn't deter the winning bidder on Saturday.", "reference": "Collector says he bought the outfit as it was about to be thrown away .\nVivien Leigh wore it in several key scenes in the 1939 movie .", "pred_summary": "The gray two-piece ensemble was worn by Vivien Leigh in the 1939 movie.\nIt was the most sought after item among 150 pieces of \"Gone With the Wind\" memorabilia on sale.\n collector bought it decades ago for $20 as it was on the verge of being tossed out."}

At the event Chevrolet also unveiled a new car in its Malibu range, the Bolt EV Concept vehicle and the 2015 Captiva. Self-driving cars may be a way to take your eyes off the road and relax a little, but they can also increase travel sickness, research has found. The research was carried out by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. They asked more than 3,200 adults across the US, India, China, Japan, Great Britain and Australia what kinds of activities they would do instead of driving in a fully self-driving vehicle. More than a third of Americans said they would do things that increase the likelihood and severity of motion sickness, including reading, texting, watching movies or television, playing games or working. More than half of Indians, 40 per cent of Chinese and up to 30 per cent of adults in Japan, Great Britain and Australia said they would also engage in these kinds of activities. The figures suggest that once autonomous vehicles become more mainstream as many as 12 per cent of people will feel ill in the vehicles at some point during a journey.

{"article": "Researchers sketching out a 'wiring diagram' for rat brains have discovered its structure is organized like the Internet. They say the animal's cerebral cortex is 'like a mini-Internet'. The first comprehensive picture of how neurons connect to one another found local networks of neurons layered like the shells in a Russian nesting doll. The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. The brain operates in a similar way, the researchers found. 'The cerebral cortex is like a mini-Internet,' said Larry Swanson, professor at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and corresponding author of a paper on the discovery. 'The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. 'The brain operates in a similar way.' The study was published on April 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. For years, scientists looking for clues to brain function through its structure focused on what could be seen \u2014 the brain's lobes, grooves and folds. Two local networks \u2014 one governing vision and learning, and another tapped into bodily concerns like muscle and organ function \u2014 make up the inner shell of the rat's cerebral cortex. Two others \u2014 one governing smell, and another that assembles and makes sense of the information from the other three networks \u2014 make up the outer shell. This means that certain flows of information are genetically 'hardwired' into the brain, Swanson said. The discovery is the result of a massive, labor-intensive effort to organize 40 years' worth of data from peer-reviewed research articles detailing connections in rat brains. 'The data was already out there; it just needed to be compiled into a more useful format,' Swanson said. Lead author Mihail Bota of USC Dornsife created the database from more than 16,000 reports of connections, which he weighted both on the strength of the connection and the reliability of the methodology used to discover it. The process took more than 4,000 hours to complete, yielding a database that is free and available. Olaf Sporns of Indiana University subsequently performed a network analysis of the connections. A color-coded flat map of 1,923 rat cortical association macroconnections (RCAMs). The team used studies of rat brains because of the sheer volume of detailed information available. Swanson believes that the database can create an important link between human brain studies \u2014 which are largely done as non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging scans \u2014 and rat brain studies, which can be more in-depth. 'Having a wiring diagram for the brain will allow knowledge to flow both ways between human and animal studies,' Swanson said. 'This allows us to take theories from human brain scan studies and experimentally verify them in animals, and discoveries made in animal studies are likely to have an analogue in humans.' 'We're bridging the gap between our work in rat brains and the Stevens Institute's work with human brains,' Swanson said. 'If we can connect these two veins of neuroscience in a concrete and meaningful way, then we can dramatically expand our reservoir of information about the brain practically overnight.' In the future, Swanson hopes to be able to expand the neural-connection map of the rat brain beyond the cerebral cortex, some day mapping the entire nervous system.", "reference": "Researchers say the cerebral cortex of rats is 'like a mini-Internet'\nTeam planning to look at human brain in the same way .", "pred_summary": "USC researchers say rat brain is 'like a mini-Internet'\n'Wiring diagram' shows how neurons connect to one another.\nResearchers hope to one day map the entire nervous system."}
{"article": "Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)A border guard was killed in a cross-boundary fire exchange with militants in Yemen this week, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported Thursday -- marking Saudi Arabia's first publicly known military death since it launched airstrikes against rebels inside its southern neighbor. The clash occurred Wednesday night at the border in southwestern Saudi Arabia's Asir region, when militants in a mountainous area on the Yemeni side fired on Saudi border troops, prompting them to return fire, SPA reported. Besides the slain border guard -- identified as Cpl. Salman Ali Yahya al-Maliki -- 10 others suffered injuries that were not life-threatening, the Saudi media outlet said. On Thursday, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, a neutral security official and two Houthi commanders in Aden told CNN. The palace had been where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who fled the country last month, had stayed for a period of time after Houthis secured control of the capital, Sanaa, in January. According to the security official, Houthis now control most large districts in Aden amid ongoing clashes. Yemeni special forces, considered pro-Houthi and loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, arrived in Aden on Thursday in an attempt \"to secure the city,\" a Saudi official with knowledge of the situation told CNN. \"I can now confirm that it is not Saudi special forces who have landed but Yemeni special forces loyal to Saleh who landed by small boat. They are few in number and have made their way to the old parliament building,\" the intelligence official said. U.S. Navy warships, meanwhile, were patrolling off Yemen in search of suspicious shipping in the region, in particular any weapons shipments from Iran to the Houthi rebels they are supporting in Yemen, a U.S. defense official told CNN. The Navy on Wednesday came across a Panamanian-registered cargo ship that had left an Iranian port, the official said. Based on the route of the ship from Iran to Yemen, the Navy declared it a \"vessel of interest\" and requested permission from the captain to search it. The ship was found to be carrying cement and construction materials, the official said. It was sent on its way. The offshore area has been a route for weapons smuggling into Yemen, as well as Sudan and Gaza, so the Navy has maintained a regular surveillance presence there. The official said that increased fighting in the last several days in southern Yemen has resulted in other ships trying to dock to help civilians leave the country. Marie Claire Feghali, an International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman in Sanaa, described events in Aden as \"extremely fluid and very, very complicated.\" \"Hospitals are still struggling, running out of supplies. So are we,\" she said. \"We cannot move much in Aden due to the intense fighting and chaos.\" A hospital near heavy fighting was forced to shut down.

{"article": "A Massachusetts police department was forced to pay a $500 Bitcoin ransom to hackers who encrypted vital records on their computer network. Tewksbury Police Department came under  attack by criminals who infected their network with a form of Internet malware in December before demanding money to decrypt the files. The program called CryptoLocker infects  through an e-mail and then scrambles the data on the computer. It caused police systems to be down between four and five days, according to Tewksbury Town Crier. Tewksbury Police Department (above) came under attack by hackers which encrypted their computers' files using a malware program called CryptoLocker. They were forced to pay a $500 in Bitcoinransom . The only files that were not corrupted were 18 months old, so cops were left paying the ransom in the untraceable digital currency or they risked losing the data forever, according to the\u00a0Boston Globe. 'Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the Town Crier. 'We did everything we possibly could. 'It was an eye opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan said: 'It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort' The department was hit with the ransomware on December 7 when access to the infected computers became restricted and a payment was required to recover the files.\u00a0Police became aware of the malware infection the following day. Computers were hit with a more recent form of CryptoLocker that authorities did not have the key to, said Sheehan. It is believed that the Officer In Charge's computer  became infected and the virus traveled to the largest store of data on the network which held files including arrest logs, motor vehicle records, calls for service and records management, according to the Town Crier. CryptoLocker is malware that is often installed on computers at the same time. CryptoLocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. Computers can become corrupted through phishing emails that include malicious attachments and pop-up ads. According to reports from last year, the U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. When a Tewksbury officer tried to access the data, a demand for $500 was sent from a web address and account that is untraceable by authorities including the FBI and National Security Agency. After this sort of infection occurs there are only two options which include accessing the most recent back-up or paying the ransom. As Tewksbury's back-up was corrupted they were forced to pay the ransom, but Sheehan also noted that the malware infection was not a data breach. 'This isn't a breach. [The data] stays interior, but this virus encrypts it and prevents it from being readable,' Sheehan told the Town Crier. Tewksbury is not the first police department to be a victim of ransomware in the U.S. Similar incidents have occurred involving Swansea Police Department which paid a $750 ransom in November 2013, according to Town Crier. Police in Midlothian, Illinois most recently paid a $500 ransom in January.", "reference": "Tewksbury Police Department was attacked by criminals who infected their network with  malware program called CryptoLocker .\nCryptoLocker restricts access to infected computers and demands payment to recover files .\nPolice systems were down between four and five days, and ransom was paid in digital currency by cops in bid to not lose data forever .", "pred_summary": "Hackers infected Tewksbury Police Department with Internet malware.\nThey demanded $500 in Bitcoin to unlock files.\nOnly files that were not corrupted were 18 months old."}
{"article": "The traditional cookie cutter wedding no longer exists - new reports suggest Brits are ditching tradition in favour of alternative practices when it comes to getting hitched. Two of the biggest changes are the fact that religious services have fallen out of favour and that brides are opting for bold colour schemes for their big day. A new study, which has tracked the decisions of brides and grooms over the past five years interviewed 1,893 newlyweds and compared them to answers they have collated since 2010. Scroll down for video . A new study has revealed the changing habits of British weddings. When it comes to honeymooning 18 per cent of us are now choosing to holiday in the UK compared to 8 per cent five years ago . The study showed that couples are shunning religious ceremonies when it comes to their big day with services falling from 40 per cent to 35 in the past five years. Registry offices have seen an increase in bookings by two thirds, going from three per cent to nine per cent since 2010, and 50 per cent of bride and grooms have opted for some form of civil ceremony when getting hitched. Tradition seems to be out of the window when it comes to paying the bill. In 2014, just seven per cent of UK couples allowed the bride's parents to pay the entire bill, down from nine per cent in 2010, while over a third of married couples in the UK (31.4 per cent) covered their entire wedding bill themselves. The trend for cupcakes is falling out of favour sinking from appearing at 15 per cent of weddings to just 10 per cent, however cheese towers are on the up by three per cent since 2011 . The study by hitched.co.uk also showed that spending on weddings as a whole is increasing, up by 3.4 per cent year on year, outpacing the economic growth of 2.8 per cent. The average cost of a wedding is now \u00a316,020 (compared to \u00a315,494.54 in 2013). Forking out for our own weddings seems to be having a knock on effect as lavish honeymoons are less popular than they once were. Newlyweds are now choosing to honeymoon closer to home, with 18 per cent opting for a vacation in the UK, compared to eight per cent just five years ago. 32 per cent choose Europe, an increase of 11 per cent in five years, while honeymoon visits to the rest of the world has plummeted from 71 per cent to 50. It seems that many are also less keen to jet off immediately, with just 39 per cent of us going on our honeymoon within two days of the wedding, compared to 47 per cent in 2010. Peach bridesmaid dresses are out as the favoured colour scheme for a wedding is now purple . It's good news for bridesmaids though - peach is no longer the colour scheme of choice for dresses. Purple is now the most popular colour in the UK (19 per cent), followed by blue (18 per cent). Another favourite that has fallen out of favour is cupcakes - in 2011, 15 per cent of weddings opted for them as an alternative to a traditional wedding cake, but they are now chosen by just 10 per cent of couples for their reception. This doesn't mean you will necessarily have to choke back some heavily iced fruit cake though, as five per cent of couples now have a cake made of cheese, up from two per cent in 2010. Caroline Hendry, Editor of hitched.co.uk says that our changing attitudes towards weddings are seeing new traditions created. She said: 'As well as a snapshot of trends that might come and go we can see some longer term patterns emerging, with the decline of the religious ceremony and the expectation that parents would foot the bill. 'Couples seem more keen to foot the bill for drinks, but at the same time they are still under financial pressure, so other things need to give like the lavish honeymoon with more couples honeymooning in the UK or Europe or taking longer to save.'", "reference": "A new survey of newlyweds reveals Britain's changing wedding habits .\nReligious ceremonies have fallen by five per cent in the past five years .\n18 per cent of couples are now choosing to honeymoon in the UK .", "pred_summary": "The traditional cookie cutter wedding no longer exists - new reports suggest Brits are ditching tradition in favour of alternative practices.\nReligious services falling from 40% to 35 in the past five years.\n brides are opting for bold color schemes for their big day.\nThe average cost of a wedding is now \u00a316,020 (compared to \u00a315,493.54 in 2013)"}
{"article": "(CNN)At first police in Marana, Arizona, thought the shoplifted gun Mario Valencia held as he walked through a busy office park was locked and unable to fire. The cable through the lever and trigger couldn't be taken off, an officer was told by an employee of the Walmart where Valencia took the gun and some rounds of ammunition. But just 10 seconds after the worker told police that ... a shot. Valencia had fired into the air, and less than a minute later a police car slammed into him in a move that ended a crime spree and sparked nationwide discussion on the officer's unusual tactic. The 36-year-old Valencia was hospitalized and within a few days transferred to jail where he faces 15 charges, including shoplifting the .30-30 rifle. That February morning, police have said, Valencia committed several crimes in nearby Tucson before stealing a car and driving to the Walmart in Marana. There he went to the sporting goods department, asked to see a rifle, then told an employee he wanted the ammunition. Officer who drove into suspect justified, chief says . The woman told police she gave Valencia the rounds because he told her he would break the case with the bullets inside. He also told her not to do anything stupid. In spite of that she also said she didn't feel threatened, leading police to charge him with shoplifting and not armed robbery. Walmart told CNN's Miguel Marquez that  the store clerk acted appropriately, even using a code to alert security to call police. Valencia took the gun and ammo and fled into a nearby business park where he encountered an officer in a slow-moving patrol car. At one point he pointed the weapon at an officer and at another he pointed it at his head. The officer told him several times to put down the gun, police have said. The officers that were tailing him assumed that he likely couldn't shoot anyone because of the store's lock. Marana police on Thursday said the cable gun lock was still on the rifle when it was recovered. But the wire that goes through the trigger and the lever to reload the gun were loose enough to allow it to still be used, police said. It also should have been wrapped through the lever twice, not once, police said. A Walmart spokesman told CNN that the rifle had been properly locked and might have been affected by the hard blow caused by the police car. Valencia, who is in Pima County Jail, will appear in court again on May 18.", "reference": "Before he was slammed into by a police car, Mario Valencia fired a rifle with a loosened lock .\nHe shoplifted the gun and ammo from a Walmart, where a saleswoman who showed him the weapon alerted security .\nWalmart says the lock was properly installed but police say it was loose when it was found .", "pred_summary": "Mario Valencia was arrested after a police car slammed into him.\nPolice said they thought the gun he was holding was locked and couldn't be used."}

The Swedish retailer has been forced to take action to stop visitors kicking off their shoes and going to sleep on their beds and sofas. The problem has got so bad that nappers had taken over more than half of beds and sofas in the Xihongmen IKEA shop in Beijing, The People\u2019s Daily\u00a0reported \u2013 with some even getting under the covers for a snooze. Scroll down for video . Managers at Swedish furniture store IKEA have now banned shoppers from sleeping in their beds and sofas . Sleepy shoppers have taken to kicking off their shoes and catching forty winks on the display furniture . The practice has become widespread in IKEA stores - with shoppers coming in especially to take a nap . One weary woman said she had come into IKEA especially to grab a quick forty winks in one of their \u2018comfy\u2019 beds. She said she didn\u2019t think it was a big issue, saying: \u2018Yes it may affect customers who were shopping in the store but it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem.\u2019 Another customer said: \u2018Sleeping on the furniture will definitely affect other customers. I can understand the need to take a rest however if you are really having a sleep then that\u2019s not very appropriate.\u2019 One shopper said: 'Yes it may affect customers... but it shouldn't be too much of a problem'. Ikea disagree . IKEA employees said the problem is difficult to manage, because so many Chinese shoppers do it . But long-suffering staff at IKEA said the problem has become widespread across China \u2013 with management vowing to clamp down on the practice. Under the new rules customers will still be allowed to try out the sofas and beds, but the removal of shoes to sleep in the beds is banned. One anonymous IKEA assistant warned, however, it will be difficult to enforce the rules. \u2018There are old people sleeping and many others are children, what can we say?\u2019 they said. Another employee explained that they currently wake up shoppers if they have been sleeping for an extended period of time \u2013 but when they move them on, another quickly fills their place. By banning people from taking off their shoes, IKEA hope to stop Chinese shoppers falling asleep in the stores . Workers at IKEA shops regularly wake up exhausted shoppers - but another napper quickly takes their place . They added: \u2018There are too many people doing this, it\u2019s not possible to stop it.\u2019 The MailOnline previously reported on the trend, which commentators saying their Beijing store is particularly popular for a nap because of its air-conditioning during the sweltering summers. It is not the first time IKEA has had to deal with over-familiar customers in China. One Shanghai Xuhui store was inundated with pensioners who would spend their time drinking the free coffee \u2013 and on the prowl for a new partner for their children. The practice became so popular that telling people you were going to IKEA became a euphemism in China for \u2018going to a matchmaking event\u2019. Genuine shoppers have been unable to see the furniture on sales because of the sleeping people on top of it . IKEA opened up their first shop in China in 1999 and the country is now home to three of the top five largest IKEA stores in the world, only beaten by one in Stockholm. After the first shop opened in Beijing, pictures emerged of shoppers camping out on the sofas with their families, reading newspapers and eating biscuits.

{"article": "The Taliban annual 'spring offensive' began today in Afghanistan with the jihadi group claiming responsibility for  108 attacks in the opening five hours. A US air base near Kabul and military outposts in Nuristan were targeted today as the militants continue to pursue territory in north east Afghanistan. According to the official spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, over 80 per cent of Afghanistan is currently 'controlled' by the Taliban. Whilst their figures are exaggerated, the Taliban's new offensive is set to the start of fresh violence in the troubled country. Taliban militants opened the offensive today with a failed rocket attack on a US base in Bagram air base, situated close to the Afghan capital city of Kabul. Taliban militants opened the offensive today with a failed rocket attack on a US base in Bagram air base, situated close to the Afghan capital city of Kabul. The rocket landed harmlessly in base and despite the Taliban claims that they had 'killed and wounded hundreds of Americans', no casualties have been reported. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were also reportedly detonated in Kunar and Khost province. Casualty numbers remain unconfirmed but the attacks symbolize a worrying indicator of the broad areas being targeted by the Taliban. The Taliban announced the launch of Operation Azm, meaning 'determination', on Wednesday, revealing fresh plans to target government buildings and Afghan security forces. The Taliban have been waging an jihadi insurgency since they were forced out of power in late 2001. With the emergence of ISIS, the Taliban are already facing a struggle for power in Afghanistan. The extremists want to turn Afghanistan into an Islamic Emirate, governed by strict sharia law. In December, photos emerged of a robber being publicly executed by Taliban fighters with machine guns. The Taliban announced the launch of Operation Azm, meaning 'determination', on Wednesday, revealing fresh plans to target government buildings and Afghan security forces in what is expected to be the bloodiest fighting season in a decade. With NATO forces pulling back from the frontlines, concerns remain whether trained Afghan forces will be able to consistently repel the expected barrage of Taliban attacks. 'The Islamic Emirate is going to launch the spring operations under the inspirational name of 'Azm' (Determination) at 5 am on 24th April 2015,' the Taliban said in a statement on Wednesday, using their official name. 'The main targets of these operations... will be the foreign occupiers, especially their permanent military bases... officials of the stooge regime, their military constellations, especially their intelligence, interior ministry and defence ministry officials.' Former Afghan Taliban fighters are seen holding weapons before they hand them over, as part of a government peace and reconciliation initiative, at a ceremony in Jalalabad recently. NATO's combat mission formally ended in December but a small follow-up foreign force has stayed on to train and support local security personnel. US President Barack Obama last month backpedaled on plans to shrink the US force in Afghanistan this year by nearly half, agreeing to keep the current level of 9,800 US troops until the end of 2015. The Taliban, who have waged a deadly insurgency since they were ousted from power in late 2001, said the announcement would damage any prospect of peace talks as they vowed to continue fighting. Aside from the Taliban, the Afghan government has also repeatedly warned of the Islamic State (IS) group making inroads into the country. President Ashraf Ghani blamed IS for a suicide attack last Saturday in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100 others. If verified, that would mark the first major attack by the jihadists in the country. President Ashraf Ghani blamed IS for a suicide attack last Saturday in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100 others. Afghan security forces are struggling to cope with the new offensive across Afghanistan \u00a0particularly with the gradual withdrawal of NATO forces . The upsurge in attacks has taken a heavy toll on ordinary Afghans. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), the number of civilians killed and wounded up by 22 percent in 2014 compared to the previous year. In the first three months of 2015, civilian casualties from ground fighting were up eight percent on the same period last year, a new UNAMA report said. But in their statement, the Taliban said their 'top priority will be given to safeguard and protect the lives and properties of the civilian people' during the offensive.

{"article": "He has long struggled to convince voters that he is a suitable choice for prime minister. Now Ed Miliband has hired a leadership coaching firm that helps people overcome anxiety and find their \u2018inner voice\u2019. The consultants drafted in by the Labour leader claim to work with politicians to build \u2018leadership skills\u2019 using \u2018neuroscience\u2019 and \u2018business psychology\u2019. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband, pictured, has hired a US guru who can help him convince himself that he can be Prime Minister . Mr Miliband, pictured, has constantly lagged behind Prime Minister David Cameron in the personal rating polls . Services offered by ExtendedMind include coaching on how to look \u2018authentic\u2019 and tutorials on how to build alliances \u2013 which may come in useful during negotiations with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. The firm, which uses some American spellings despite being based in Britain, details how it can help politicians on its website. It says: \u2018When we\u2019re working with leaders who want to communicate their messages with greater impact, it\u2019s typically the \u201chow\u201d of their style that we support, improving body language, breathing, posture and prosody.\u2019 In a section entitled \u2018The Politics of Authenticity\u2019, it adds: \u2018Is learning new communication techniques just a question of artifice rather than authenticity? \u2018Our answer to that question would be \u201cyes\u201d, if you don\u2019t throw yourself into the learning process and practice! Any new behaviour will feel inauthentic at the beginning, and will seem so to others, too. But with repeated practice we move from \u201cacting\u201d to \u201cbeing\u201d.\u2019 When Ed Miliband tried to make a conference speech off the cuff in September, he forgot to mention the deficit and was roundly ridiculed. So ever since then he has made sure he always has one trusty aide at his side ... a lectern, right. Whether he is in a town hall, a car park or a factory during the election campaign, the prop \u2013 often holding helpful notes to jog his memory \u2013 has been there for him to lean on. His advisors believe the lectern makes him look more like a prime minister-in-waiting. But its non-stop UK tour has begun to look increasingly bizarre after he even dragged it into the car park of a Leicestershire factory, where it was carefully positioned between puddles. This week he spoke from a lectern as he launched Labour campaign billboards in Nuneaton, Warwickshire ... even though he was in the middle of a cricket pitch. The website continues: \u2018The anxiety we all feel to different degrees when communicating an important message to others \u2013 and which can side-swipe our message \u2013 can be erased so that our inner voice can find its way into the world.\u2019 And in a sign that the firm could help Mr Miliband prepare to negotiate post-election deals, it notes: \u2018Our intelligent networks process encourages people to think about what they want to achieve [and] identify the people who might collaborate with them to achieve those goals.\u2019 Mr Miliband has consistently lagged behind David Cameron in polls on their personal ratings during his five years as Labour leader. But he has seen a slight boost in his popularity since the campaign began last month. After the seven-way televised leaders\u2019 debate on ITV, it emerged that Mr Miliband had been reading from motivational notes \u2013 including one reminding him to be a \u2018happy warrior\u2019. His cribsheet, found in his dressing room after the clash, also prompted him to \u2018relish the chance to show who I am\u2019. Mr Miliband has hired ExtendedMind despite already employing David Axelrod, a former adviser to Barack Obama, on six figures. One Labour MP said Mr Axelrod had so far been \u2018invisible\u2019 in the campaign, adding: \u2018I don\u2019t understand what we are getting for the \u00a3300,000, I think it is an obscene amount.\u2019 Mr Axelrod, who is based in the US, has insisted he is in touch with Mr Miliband \u2018all the time\u2019 by phone, text and email. Asked yesterday whether his use of ExtendedMind had been \u2018helpful\u2019, Mr Miliband told a press conference: \u2018I will let other people make a judgment on those questions. I take advice from a range of people.\u2019 A Labour spokesman said: \u2018We don\u2019t comment on people we may or may not have employed.\u2019 ExtendedMind did not respond to a request for comment.

{"article": "This incredible video shows the moment a world freediving champion jumped into the world\u2019s second deepest underwater sink hole. The dramatic footage shows Guillame N\u00e9ry standing at the edge before jumping in - all without scuba gear and simply holding his breath. And in the video he seemingly reaches the bottom of the 660ft (200 metes) hole before swimming back to the surface. French free diver jumped into Dean's Blue Hole in the Bahamas. Guillame N\u00e9ry is seen at the edge before taking the plunge (shown). The hole is 660ft (200 metres) deep, although he doesn't go to the bottom. Free divers are able to hold their breath for more than 20 minutes . The video was filmed in 2010 by the Frenchman's girlfriend and fellow freediver Julie Gautier. It takes place at Dean\u2019s Blue Hole in the Bahamas, the deepest so-called \u2018blue hole\u2019 in the world with an underwater entrance. In order to stay alive, the brain is constantly telling the body to breathe. If you don\u2019t obey its primitive urges, carbon dioxide soon starts building up in the body, prompting an overwhelming desire to take a gulp of air. To fight that instinct, a competitive breath-holder has to work hard at expanding his lung capacity with a regular series of intensive breathing exercises. They practise \u2018static apnoea\u2019 once or twice a week, as well as \u2018dynamic apnoea\u2019 - holding breath while swimming - once in a while for fun, and also general fitness training. He also follows a diet high in fruit and vegetables, as well as broccoli, cauliflower and fish oil. However, N\u00e9ry revealed a few years ago that he didn\u2019t really reach the bottom of the hole - it\u2019s just filmed that way for artistic reasons. But the video is still incredibly impressive, as he holds his breath for minutes on end. Freediving is a form of underwater diving where no scuba gear or breathing apparatus is used. To breathe for minutes, free divers go through sophisticated mind-body control techniques to push self-induced apnoea - the science of not breathing - to the limits. Some free divers can hold their breath for more than 20 minutes. Stig Severinsen, for example - nicknamed The Man Who Doesn't Breathe - is the holder of multiple records in diving using his 'State of Zen' technique to control his breathing. In October 2012, Mr Severinsen broke the record for the longest time breath held voluntarily by a male by spending 22 minutes with his head submerged in a pool in London. The dive took place in 2010 at Dean\u2019s Blue Hole in the Bahamas (marked), the deepest so-called \u2018blue hole\u2019 in the world with an underwater entrance .

{"article": "Sacked: Peter Gale was dismissed by Nonsuch High School For Girls in Surrey two weeks ago . The male headmaster of a leading all-girls\u2019 grammar school has been sacked after sending a series of private emails to a teenage pupil, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Peter Gale, 47, was dismissed by Nonsuch High School For Girls in Surrey for \u2018unprofessional and inappropriate conduct\u2019 two weeks ago. At the time of the announcement, the school\u2019s governors failed to release any more details. However, an investigation by this newspaper has discovered that Mr Gale \u2013 who became the academy\u2019s first male head when he was appointed to the post 18 months ago \u2013 sent informal emails over a period of months to the sixth-form pupil, including messages written at night and during the holidays. School rules strictly forbid teachers sending messages to pupils from private email accounts. The Cheam academy has described Mr Gale\u2019s actions a \u2018serious breach of safeguarding procedures\u2019. Despite this, the National Union of Teachers appeared to play down the seriousness of his conduct. In a statement to The Mail on Sunday, the union implied Mr Gale\u2019s actions only amounted to a breach of the school\u2019s information and communications technology rules. The governors \u2013 who began their investigation following a tip-off \u2013 are said to have been \u2018stunned\u2019 by the NUT statement. The specialist science college and languages school, which counts singer Katie Melua and Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell among its alumni, passed judgment on Mr Gale at an internal disciplinary hearing earlier this month, ruling he had broken rules in place to prevent personal communications between staff and pupils. It is understood this was in breach of guidance telling teachers never to use a private email account to send messages to pupils, partly for their own protection. The school has refused to reveal the precise content of the emails, but it is understood they were informal and read like text messages. It is believed there were also concerns about the way Mr Gale, the former deputy headmaster of all-girl Rosebery School in nearby Epsom, had treated the student differently from other pupils. Mr Gale, who is understood to be unmarried and who lives in Godalming, Surrey, declined to comment directly to The Mail on Sunday. Messages: An investigation by the Mail on Sunday has revealed it was a series of 'informal' emails to a sixth form pupil which led to his dismissal from the specialist science college \u00a0(pictured) Alumni: Former pupils include Kate Melua (pictured) and\u00a0Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell . But a statement sent to this newspaper, released by the NUT\u2019s London Regional Secretary Bob Stapley, said: \u2018The alleged misconduct related to communication with a student which breached the school\u2019s policy on the accepted use of ICT [information and communications technology]. \u2018Mr Gale accepted he had breached the school\u2019s policy and that as headmaster he had responsibility for ensuring he and other staff acted in accordance with the policy. Defence: The NUT have said: 'Mr Gale vehemently denies he behaved inappropriately towards any student and no such finding was made'.

Mr Bird, who runs an aerial photography business in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, captured the video on Tuesday with a Go Pro 4 while on holiday with his family. The 41-year-old said that he was \u2018as close to the action as you could get\u2019, having gone to the area after hearing on the news that Nato exercises were taking place in the area. He said: \u2018I went to see what I could capture. I wasn't really sure what I would get but it was fantastic watching the video back. \u2018They came in very low and were preparing to land, but they were still under quite a lot of throttle.

{"article": "(CNN)Every week in the heart of Nima, a slum in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, families congregate at a local mosque. When the time comes, young girls say goodbye to their loved ones and part ways, filing up concrete steps leading up to the floor above. There, inside a large room dotted with brown tables, rows of flashing computer screens await for them. \"When the parents are praying [downstairs], we are teaching the girls upstairs,\" explains tech entrepreneur Regina Agyare, who comes here every week to teach local teens how to code. Agyare's first visit to see the girls -- students at education project Achievers Ghana -- was in January 2014. This was supposed to be a one-off seminar as part of her mentorship initiative \"Tech Needs Girls\" -- however, the students proved quite a draw. \"I fell in love with them, so I decided to set up a coding club and started having regular sessions,\" says Agyare, founder of software development company Soronko Solutions. More importantly, continues Agyare, it offered the opportunity to show \"the community the value of educating girls.\" A predominantly Muslim area in a largely Christian nation, Nima has one of the densest populations in Accra. Agyare says life is often challenging for many  local girls, with some growing up without ever leaving the community. \"Girls were being forced to marry early; [denied] their right to go to school. Most of their dreams and aspirations were limited to just what was around them. \"I was shocked... I thought we had progressed as a nation. I thought we had gone past that.\" This, in part, was why Agyare lent her support to Achievers Ghana. Set up by local Amadu Mohammad, the non-profit organization supports 250 girls between the age of six and 18, priming them for formal education through extracurricular classes in reading, math, poetry and information technology. Its goal is to break through social barriers and provide Nima with a generation of female role models, and so the group provides school funding to help the girls shape their own future. The project was bequeathed its classroom above the mosque it shares a building with, and Agyare says the two work closely together. Achievers Ghana met initial resistance from local conservatives, but when the mosque's chief imam Sheik Hussein Abdul Rahman championed Mohammad's vision, few maintained their reservations. Now, with parents paying a nominal fee towards the running of the organization, it is in everyone's interest that the girls succeed. Fourteen months after her first visit, Agyare's coding class is well established. She has set up a mentor scheme as part of \"Tech Needs Girls,\" recruiting and training women at university to act as role models for her younger students in Nima. In each class, around 50 girls are taught HTML and run a blog called \"Slum Voices\". \"I definitely feel [technology] has given them more of a voice,\" Agyare says. \"I feel like it's allowed them to express themselves and interact with others... for them, it's important to be heard.\" Some girls had never used a computer before the classes began, but Agyare's even-handed approach has brought all her students up to the same standard. Agyare insists that \"we don't leave anyone behind.\" To that end, a few young male faces have found their way into her classroom. This was an accidental revelation, according to Agyare. She details the story of one affronted boy. \"He wrote that he didn't like it when he saw girls learning about computers... it was difficult [for him] to see girls being empowered; he wasn't used to that.\" Agyare realized that by integrating genders in her classroom she could begin to confront gender expectations. For many boys the role of a girl is \"to be their wife,\" Agyare explains, \"and she needs to be taken care of.\" However, by running mixed classes boys from an early age \"can learn to see a woman as a contributing person [within society].\" Now the hope is that many of the young students will be able to go to university -- and Achievers Ghana is working on a scholarship program to make the prospect attainable. Agyare says the goal is not to turn every girl into software developers but to enable them to \"use technology in whatever field they find themselves.\" She adds: \"It would be great if we had some girls that decided to go on and study computer science, but really it's about helping them reach their full potential ... and bring change to the community.\" Read this: 5 reasons why tech needs geek girls .

{"article": "Britain's biggest purpose-built air raid shelter, which could hold 6,500 people, was so sophisticated it even had electric lighting and flush toilets. The tunnels were dug into sandstone cliffs along the River Mersey in Stockport in the 1930s, and were originally intended to provide car parking spaces. But following the outbreak of the Second World War, the space was redeveloped as an air raid shelter where residents of Lancashire and Cheshire could hide from Nazi bombs. Scroll down for video . Shelter: This shows one of the rooms of Britain's largest purpose-built air raid shelter, located in Stockport, Greater Manchester . Safe: A bunker lined with corrugated steel to protect against the possible effects of a Nazi bombing raid during the Second World War . Tunnels: A total of 6,500 people could fit into the shelter, which was made up of a network of interconnecting passages . Entrance: The shelter has been converted into a museum, replicating the conditions which would have been found 75 years ago . The shelter became so popular that local officials had to issue season tickets limiting the number of people who would be allowed to seek refuge there. The cliffs were first dug out to provide cellars for homes along Chestergate, one of the busiest streets in Stockport. As part of a plan to widen the roads, the local council bought and demolished the houses, and planned to convert the cellars into an underground car park. An engineering survey showed that the space was in fact unable to become a car park - but the advent of war meant that it was needed as an air raid shelter. Bathroom: The women's toilets, equipped with a proper flush, located deep inside the Stockport air raid shelter . Gadgets: A radio, blood pressure monitor and lamp from the 1940s, pictured inside the air raid shelter's first aid section . Medicine: The shelter had a first aid room to help any residents who were injured by the bombing raids . Equipment: Gas masks which were kept in the shelter are pictured left; right is the sick bay, where people could seek shelter while unwell . Extent: The shelter was going to be turned into a car park, but officials discovered that its long tunnels were unsuitable for the purpose . Curator Howard Green said: 'The official capacity was 3,850, so outside they painted 4,000 - but what they didn't advertise was that they thought they could squeeze twice as many in if needs be. 'They were used extensively by people from Manchester and Salford, and even as far as Eccles. Stockport was less of a target, and the underground shelters were a particularly safe place. 'What they did was introduce season tickets - they were issued to locals, although you could write in if you had difficult circumstances. We still have some letters from people in Manchester who'd been bombed out several times. 'It was really only a way of damping down demand, nobody was denied entrance in an alert. In the winter of 1940 and '41, it went up to 6,500, with another four sets of tunnel shelters. History: A photograph of the shelter as it appeared in the 1930s, around the time of the Second World War's outbreak . Rambling: The tunnels were large enough to fit in 6,500 people, who came from all around Lancashire, Cheshire and Manchester . Emergency: Local councils had to establish air raid shelters to protect their populations from German bomb attacks . Base: The room belonging to the shelter's warden, who would have been responsible for ensuring the safety of those inside . Danger: A fire bucket and hose which could have been used to control any unexpected blazes in the tunnels . 'People are always surprised by the extent of them, and just how much thought and planning went into them. There were first aid posts, electric lighting and flush toilets, which people living in back-to-back cottages of town centres wouldn't have had at home.' The shelter space is now operated as a museum, and has been restored to how it might have looked to residents hiding there during the war.

De Bruyne, who spent his two years at Chelsea largely on loan before joining the second-placed Bundesliga club, has scored nine goals this season and is topping the league's assist charts with 16 \u2013 seven more than the next best. But Ribery says despite his impressive form the 23-year-old Belgian is the wrong style of player to come in under Pep Guardiola because he has different assets to himself and the Holland winger. Kevin de Bruyne is linked with Bayern Munich as a potential replacement for the club's veteran forwards . The Wolfsburg playmaker, here in action for Belgium against Israel, has 16 assists and nine goals this season . Bayern's Franck Ribery says despite De Bruyne's impressive form he is the wrong type of player for Munich . 'He is not a player who takes the ball and dribbles forward and likes to have the opponents in front of him,' Ribery told German publication Sport Bild. 'De Bruyne is great, when he fits the counterattack. At Bayern, however, you usually only have three or four metres in front of you, not a lot of room. But he is a good player and he is still young, so he can still learn.' Ribery and Robben's contracts run out in 2017 and both have endured injuries worries of late prompting reports that an injection of youth such as 23-year-old De Bruyne could be good for the club. Ribery (left) says De Bruyne's counter-attacking skills don't mesh with the style of Pep Guardiola (right) Ribery has struggled with injuries of late and has been linked with moves away from the Bundesliga leaders . Should Bayern be in the market for a young attacker, however, Ribery knows precisely who he'd want to see at Allianz Arena \u2013 De Bruyne's Belgian team-mate Eden Hazard. 'He attacks all of the time. He loves to run at his opponent,' he said. 'But he plays at Chelsea - this could be very expensive for Bayern.' If Bayern do go for De Bruyne, against their outspoken veteran's advice, they'll have competition from Manchester City, who have met with his representatives, along with Paris Saint-Germain. Wolfsburg are said to be keen to hang onto him for at least one more campaign that should include next season's Champions League.

{"article": "A transgender woman who had her face horribly damaged after it was injected with cement and tire sealant stepped out on Sunday showing off a new look. Rajee Narinesingh was one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil. Rajee had Morris inject her cheeks, lips and chin back in 2005, and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon. Scroll down for videos . Rajee Narinesingh (above), one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend . Rajee was recently treated by\u00a0Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif in a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched . Left with a 'hard-as-rock' face, Rajee began seeing\u00a0Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery in 2012, who gave her softening injections and laser therapy to treat the botched surgery. In a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self-esteem, and that men were taking notice. 'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon,' she said at the time. 'I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' Now, she has had her look improved once again by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched. Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview. She explained; 'Up until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy. 'When I used to fantasize about being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina. I didn't realize I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought \"you're not gay, you're transgender.\"' Rajee lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured (above) That all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from Dr John Martin . Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, claims she paid just $100 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005. 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' she said of her decision to get the injections. 'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction. 'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called pumping.' And while she knew she was not seeing a licensed surgeon, she was still excited the day she went to see Morris. 'When it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be,' she said. 'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures.' The room looked sterile and clean she said, and sokn after she arrived they began the procedure.

{"article": "A writer has revealed why she stopped washing her hair six years ago after embarking on a quest to try and control her greasy, limp locks - by avoiding shampoo. New Yorker Sarah Theeboom was inspired to give up using products on her hair after she ran into an old friend whose once dry, frizzy locks were smooth and shiny. When Sarah asked for her secret, her friend explained that she had simply stopped shampooing, opting to partake in the apparently-popular 'no poo' movement, which Sarah had never heard of until that moment. 'I wasn\u2019t in love with it, and I just didn\u2019t really know what to do,' she told Seventeen. 'I wanted to try my friend\u2019s trick and stop shampooing.' Scroll down for video . Natural beauty: Sarah Theeboom (pictured) hasn't washed her hair in six years after a friend told her that giving up shampoo was the secret to gorgeous locks . Although her friend warned her that her scalp and hair would go through a nasty adjustment period, Sarah wasn't prepared for the dandruff and excessive amounts of grease that she first experienced after she first started shunning shampoo during a three-week vacation to Thailand. Sarah recalled that during those first few weeks her hair was the 'greasiest' it had ever been. 'I was so embarrassed that I didn\u2019t want to show my head to anyone,' she explained. Despite the fact that she 'almost cracked' and went back to shampoo, she forged on with her mission. After vacation she started wrapping her hair with headbands every day. When she showered she would wet her hair and scrub her scalp with her fingers. And even though her boyfriend was critical of the idea, Sarah explained that, by this point, she 'felt committed' to her cause. New woman: The writer from New York City said her hair is now silkier and 'totally frizz-free' since she gave up using shampoo . It took six weeks for her hair to feel somewhat normal again and then another six weeks of her hair looking 'so-so' before the 'magic happened'. 'I started to see what my natural hair was like when I wasn\u2019t constantly doing stuff to manipulate it,' Sarah explained. 'It was silky and wavier and totally frizz-free.' The 'no poo' movement has gained popularity over recent years because of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Shailene Woodley, Adele and Jessica Simpson who have revealed that that they avoid washing their hair for days - and sometimes months - on end. Because it is no longer considered a ludicrous concept, Sarah said that she typically doesn't have a problem sharing her hair secret, but she did note that sometimes she will come across someone who just doesn't get it - including one hair stylist who didn't understand why she couldn't shampoo her hair. Sarah explained that her although her current regimen sounds like a 'beauty philosophy', she was really just experimenting to see what worked for her. 'I don\u2019t think shampoo is evil or bad for your hair...' she said. 'I still have good hair days and bad hair days, but overall, my hair looks and feels so much healthier.'", "reference": "Sarah Theeboom, from New York City, gave up using hair products as a part of the 'no poo' movement .\nThe writer battled greasy hair and dandruff for nearly two months before locks became silkier and 'totally frizz-free'", "pred_summary": "Sarah Theeboom stopped washing her hair six years ago.\nShe was inspired by an old friend whose once dry, frizzy locks were smooth and shiny.\n'I wanted to try my friend\u2019s trick and stop shampooing'"}
{"article": "A freezer trawler has sunk in a peninsula off the coast of Russia, killing at least 56 crew members. A massive rescue operation involving more than 1,300 people is now underway after the ship, carrying an international crew of 132, sank in the Sea of Okhotsk in just 15 minutes. Rescued crew members reported that the ship, called the Dalny Vostock, was unstable because of empty fuel tanks and a lack of ballast as it sailed through the\u00a0Kamchatka Peninsula. The Russian freezer trawler, called the Dalny Vostok, that sank while carrying 132 crew members at 4am on Thursday morning local time. At least 54 bodies have been recovered in the huge rescue operation . Map showing the location of the disaster. There are 13 members of the crew are still missing after the trawler tipped over when a fishing net was pulled in, a regional governor told Russian television on Thursday . It tipped over when a fishing net weighing 80 tons was pulled in, said Oleg Kozhemyako, acting governor of the nearby Sakhalin region. Kozhemyako's comments on Russian television came after the federal Investigative Committee said it was considering all possible causes for the sinking, but it was likely that the trawler hit 'an object' floating in the sea, perhaps drifting ice. More than 26 fishing boats in the area have helped to rescue members of the crew, but have also recovered 56 bodies. The disaster happened at around 4am local time, and the trawler did not send any distress signals before it sank, the Interfax News Agency said. Early reports added that the Dalny Vostok sank in just 15 minutes after its engine compartment had been flooded. So far 63 people have been rescued, with survivors suffering from hypothermia and other injuries being airlifted to hospital. At the latest count there are 13 people still missing. An emergency services representative told local media that two of the bodies were found on Thursday evening - one in a lifeboat 105 kilometres (65 miles) away, and the other in the water nearby. Those saved had managed to get into lifeboats and some had put on wet suits. The Russian Emergencies Ministry sent an Mi-8 helicopter with rescuers and doctors aboard to treat and transport rescued crew members to hospitals in the city of Magadan, it said on its website. A rescuer uses a satellite phone while onboard a helicopter as they fly over the Sea of Okhotsk scouring the waters for survivors. Around 1,300 fishermen and emergency staff are involved in the rescue operation . A Russian Emergencies Ministry ship looks for survivors after the Dalny Vostock sank. Temperatures in the water can dip to as low as -2 degrees celsius, and so far it is confirmed that 56 crew members have drowned . A telephone hotline for families of the crew has also been set up. Among the 132 crew members, 78 are from Russia, 42 from Myanmar and the rest from Latvia, Ukraine and Vanuatu. Pyotr Osichansky, president of the Far Eastern Association of Sea Captains, told Russian television that when the trawler last docked in Russia, in January, it had fewer than 70 crew members. The additional crew members were most likely picked up in Pusan, South Korea, and were working illegally, he said. The Sea of Okhotsk is the coldest sea in East Asia with the air temperature plummeting to -20 degrees Celsius in the winter months. Following the tragedy 63 people have been rescued, but the bodies of 56 sailors have been pulled from the freezing sea. Early reports say the trawler sank in 15 minutes when its engine room was flooded . Between October and April the area the area is 'constantly' covered with ice and there is very little rain, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Survivors of the incident are reportedly being interviewed as well as the owners of the trawler, as the police start investigating the disaster. It is understood they are questioning whether there was a violation of safety procedures that led to more deaths, a report in\u00a0Russia Today\u00a0said.

A City high flier jumped \u2018feet first\u2019 in front of a train after leaving his job at an investment management company to spend more time with his family, an inquest heard today. Jay Kantaria, 38, from Harrow, north-west London, had been looking forward to his daughter\u2019s birthday party when he leapt onto the tracks at his local station of Sudbury Hill. But a coroner recorded an open verdict on the cause of death, saying there was 'doubt' as to Mr Kantaria's intention when he jumped as a train passed through the station last October. North London Coroner's Court in Barnet was told the businessman had \u2018recently\u2019 left his senior position at Baring Asset Management to start a career in property development. The London School of Economics graduate died instantly of \u2018a severe traumatic brain injury\u2019 and had to be identified from his fingerprints. Coroner Andrew Walker expressed his \u2018deepest sympathies\u2019 to Mr Kantaria\u2019s 37-year-old wife, Monica, and his surviving family. He said Nairobi-born Mr Kantaria had worked as the chairman's assistant at Baring, but had decided to become a property developer. The coroner said the cause of death was \u2018a severe traumatic brain injury\u2019, consistent with being struck by a rapidly-moving train. Mr Kantaria had no alcohol or drugs in his system and did not suffer from any known psychiatric problems, Mr Walker added. Location: Mr Kantaria leapt onto the tracks at his local station of Sudbury Hill (above) in north-west London . Train driver Michael Hughes recounted how Mr Kantaria \u2018seemed to have a good look at my train\u2019. Mr Hughes said in a statement: \u2018I then lost sight of him. When I passed the bridge I saw who I believe to be the same male run to the edge of the platform and jump feet-first.' He added that he felt no impact but immediately activated the emergency brake and called for help. Detective Constable Terry Hancocks from British Transport Police said: \u2018The line speed was 100mph. He [Mr Hughes] was travelling at about 85mph\u2019. The investigator said Mr Kantaria \u2018appears to move from the platform... and then he is caught by the camera just in the air, before being struck by the train\u2019. The coroner advised Mr Kantaria\u2019s family not to view stills from the CCTV footage. Scene: The businessman died instantly of \u2018a severe traumatic brain injury\u2019 at the station (seen from above) Mr Hancocks said: \u2018I did speak to Mrs Kantaria. The gentleman had just given up his job to spend more time with his wife and children and it was completely, completely out of character. As far as the family are concerned, it was completely out of the blue.\u2019 When the coroner indicated he was ready to record the death as a suicide, Mrs Kantaria, a senior auditor at JP Morgan Chase, said: \u2018He had everything to live for. 'He was looking forward to his daughter\u2019s birthday party the following week. There is no reason I have to believe that he intended his life to come to an end.\u2019 The coroner replied: \u2018In the circumstances, I think there is a doubt in my mind about what his intention was, so I am going to leave the conclusion open. Jay Kantaria jumped in front of a train at Sudbury Hill station and died. 'The conclusion, for the reason I have said, is an open conclusion. There is no evidence to suggest he was at risk of bringing his life to an end. He had everything to live for and it just doesn\u2019t seem to make sense.\u2019 Mr Kantaria had also worked at Wellington Management and Halbis CapitalManagement - and had strengths in \u2018communication and relationship management\u2019, according to his Linkedin profile.", "reference": "Jay Kantaria, 38, leapt onto tracks at Sudbury Hill station in NW London .\nHe had recently left investment firm to start property development career .\nFamily say he had 'everything to live for' and death was 'out of the blue'\nCoroner records open verdict as case 'just doesn\u2019t seem to make sense'", "pred_summary": "'Out of character' Jay Kantaria, 38, had been looking forward to his daughter\u2019s birthday party.\nJumped 'feet first' in front of train at Sudbury Hill station in north-west London.\nCoroner recorded an open verdict on the cause of death."}

Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of Kiraz held during the armed siege last week. Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. The prosecutor, identified by state television as Kiraz, was shot in the head during the stand-off and rushed to hospital where doctors tried to save his life. Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu and hospital officials later announced he had died. Private news agency Dogan reported police special forces had entered the building, which was evacuated. It was not clear how the assailants managed to get arms into the courthouse. Mr Kiraz was the prosecutor investigating the death of a teenager who was hit by a police gas canister fired during nationwide anti-government protests in 2013. The DHKP-C, which seeks a socialist state, has carried out sporadic attacks, including a suicide bombing on the US Embassy in 2013 that killed a security guard.

{"article": "Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge . A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman . 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'", "reference": "Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time in prison for harassment-type offences .\nHe began contacting the victim after receiving her number from a cellmate .\nShe spoke to him out of sympathy, but the messages turned threatening .\nHe started telling her she was going to die and threatening her child .", "pred_summary": "Prisoner Carlos Boente was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge."}

Celtic issued a statement on Monday evening revealing they were 'seeking an understanding' of the failure to penalise Inverness defender Josh Meekings for stopping a goal-bound Leigh Griffiths header with his hand. Celtic were leading 1-0 at the time but went on to lose 3-2 and some fans have questioned how referee Steven McLean and additional assistant Alan Muir could have missed the infringement.

John Hartson, pictured at golf charity event, has urged his former club to move on from the injustice . Hartson had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside while Celtic were 2-1 down in an Old Firm League Cup final and the Welshman went on to miss a last-minute penalty that could have sparked extra-time. But he refused to dwell on the match officials' error - and called on Celtic to move on from the latest setback rather than writing letters. 'I'm not sure what sort of purpose it's going to serve,' said Hartson as he launched a 'Know Your Balls' testicular cancer awareness drive at his charity's annual golf day at Mar Hall in Bishopton.

'They got the League Cup final in the bag and they could have played a Championship team (Falkirk) in the final.

{"article": "(CNN)It's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. After all, this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a Jordanian pilot alive. Such moves are part of this murky group's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information. So what can and should we make of the organization? I explore the issue in depth in a special airing Sunday night. And although it's important to start with the caveat that ISIS is indeed trying to scare and confuse us, I took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of ISIS. First, ISIS is clearly about religion -- its version of radical Islam -- but it is also about power. There is increasing evidence that the military backbone of ISIS is made up not by a group of Islamic zealots, but rather high-ranking officers from Saddam Hussein's army -- Baathists who were at least ostensibly secular. An internal ISIS report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the German weekly Der Spiegel. That report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy, much like communism. But underneath it, much like communism, is simply a drive for control, a lust for power. Next, ISIS presents itself as a global organization, but it has thrived because of a local cause. The group has gained territory, cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the Sunnis of Iraq and Syria, who believe they must fight the Shiites to secure their own survival and strength. The reality is that that Sunni cause is going to endure for some time. The United States has been successful in its tactical battles against ISIS and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in Iraq. But the Sunnis of the region will remain in rebellion and the Sunni-dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that ISIS will be able to capitalize on this chaos. In the long run, ISIS might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so-called Caliphate. The few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by ISIS suggest that, unsurprisingly, people do not like living under a brutal, theocratic dictatorship. They live in fear, and even those who chose it as an alternative to Shiite rule are growing disenchanted. In this respect, ISIS is like other radical Islamic groups, such as the Taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract, but once they are actually governing in their medieval, barbarous manner, the allure fades and the disenchantment builds. The result is ever-increasing repression. Remember, no one has ever voted ISIS into power anywhere. The group simply slaughters its way to control. Of course, one of the big questions has been: Is ISIS a threat to the West? The group's leaders declare that it is. But their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their Arab enemies, on building a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They understand, of course, that to be Terror Group No. 1, they must battle the country that is the world's No. 1 power -- the United States. With that in mind, they seek such a confrontation and hope that the United States will come to the Middle East and fight them on their terms, on their terrain. Still, while they are opportunists, and they ask and hope that their followers act in America, their main focus is not to come here -- they want Americans to go there. Yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat ISIS poses, the group has changed the nature of terror. The leaders of ISIS have recognized that above all, they are a messaging machine, which in turn becomes a recruitment machine. This means that the key is not what happens on the ground, but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the Internet. And ISIS does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn-off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web. The shock and awe they produce makes them go viral, and thus are seen by tens of millions. That ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world's 1.6 billion Muslims -- who seek revenge, glory and gore. Unfortunately, as long as those young Muslim men, scattered across the globe, are attracted to ISIS and stream to its cause, the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month.", "reference": "Fareed Zakaria: ISIS has thrived because of a local Sunni cause in Syria and Iraq .\nLeaders of ISIS have recognized they are a messaging machine, he says .", "pred_summary": "David Frum: ISIS is about religion, but it is also about power.\nHe says the group's military backbone is made up of high-ranking officers from Saddam Hussein's army.\nFrum: ISIS thrived because of a local cause, and that Sunni cause is going to endure."}
{"article": "Daniel Sturridge's season of frustration looks set to continue as he faces a race to be fit to lead Liverpool\u2019s attack at Wembley. The England striker failed to train again on Thursday as Brendan Rodgers stepped up preparations for Sunday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, meaning Sturridge hasn\u2019t been involved in any outdoor work since before the quarter-final replay against Blackburn. Liverpool still have two more sessions before they travel south but Sturridge, who missed Monday\u2019s 2-0 win over Newcastle United with tightness in his hip, would have to involved in at least one to stand any chance of starting at Wembley. Daniel Sturridge faces a fight to be fit for Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Sunday . Striker Sturridge was left out of the squad against Newcastle on Monday after being taken off at Blackburn . It would even appear touch and go as whether Sturridge will be fit enough to make Rodgers\u2019 18-man squad, given how tormented he has been with fitness issues this season. Liverpool will give Sturridge every chance to prove his fitness but the signs at present are not encouraging. The injury is a continuation of the problem he sustained in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on March 22. Sturridge missed England\u2019s games against Lithuania and Italy with what England manager Roy Hodgson called \u2018a small tear\u2019 in his hip. Sturridge admitted last week he will not be back at his sharpest until next season and he will be glad to see the back of this campaign, having missed more than five months with a combination of thigh and calf problems. Steven Gerrard\u00a0could return at Wembley after seeing out the last game of his suspension against Newcastle . Liverpool captain Gerrard holds a '96' balloon at the Hillsborough memorial service on Wednesday . If, as appears likely, the 25-year-old is forced to play a minor role, it would leave Rodgers a decision to make with regards his starting line-up, as Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is available having served a three-match suspension. Gerrard, whose 35th birthday falls on the same day as this year\u2019s FA Cup final, missed several games in February and March with a hamstring problem but when he was fit for matches against Swansea and Manchester United, Rodgers decided to use him from the bench. He will be desperate to play at Wembley and Rodgers, who will be without cup-tied winger Jordon Ibe, must decide whether to keep faith with his current midfield of Lucas Leiva, Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen or alter his system to fit Gerrard back in. Rodgers will be without Jordon Ibe who is cup-tied having represented Derby in the FA Cup this season . Joe Allen says playing in these type of games is why he joined Liverpool from Swansea . Playing at Wembley will be a new experience for a number of Liverpool\u2019s squad and Allen says a positive result against Villa is required to enhance their development. Liverpool are favourites to reach the final but the Wales international maintains there is no complacency in the group. \u2018It\u2019s the reason you join a club like this \u2014 the dream of competing for the top prizes and potentially getting some silverware,\u2019 said Allen. \u2018There\u2019s a huge incentive for every player here. Villa had a great result on the weekend so they will be raring to go just like we will be. \u2018That will make for a great game at a historic venue.

{"article": "Plagued by a feeling something wasn't right, student Yamini Karanam sought medical help. She was struggling to understand things she had read, and felt lost in conversations. But the Indiana University PhD student could never have comprehended the source of the problem - an 'evil twin sister growing' in her brain. Surgeons operating to extract what they believed to be a tumour in her brain, were shocked to discover the growth was in fact an embryonic twin, complete with bone, hair and teeth. Yamini Karanam, 26, a student at Indiana University, was diagnosed with a pineal tumour in her brain after noticing she was struggling to comprehend things she had read, and felt lost in conversations . Known by its medical name, a brain teratoma, the growth is very rare. Indeed, Dr Hrayr Shahinian, the expert at the Skullbase Institute in Los Angeles who operated on Miss Karanam, has removed around 7,000 brain tumours and has seen just two teratomas. In the past, teratomas have\u00a0been reported to contain hair, teeth, bone and rarely more complex organs including eyes, hands, feet and limbs. And in some cases they have been found to resemble a foetus. Miss Karanam first noticed something wasn't right last September, when she struggled to register things in her mind, NBC reported. 'If a couple of people were talking in a room, I wouldn't understand what was happening,' she said. Frustrated at doctors' apparent inability to find an answer, the 26-year-old launched her own search for answers online. It led her to the Skullbase Institute and Dr Shahinian, who has developed a minimally-invasive way of reaching deep into a person's brain to extract tumours. The procedure, he said, is a type of keyhole surgery rather than traditional brain surgery, which involves opening the skull and using metal retractors to allow him to insert a microscope deep into the brain. Instead, Dr Shahinian makes a half-inch incision in the brain to use fibre-optic technology and digital imagery to gently chisel away at the tumour. Shocked when she woke to learn of Dr Shahinian's discovery, Miss Karanam branded the tumour her 'evil twin sister who's been torturing me for the past 26 years'. Dr Shahinian said he feared the tumour could be cancerous. But surgeons operating on the 26-year-old discovered the growth, indicated just above the red dot above, was in fact a teratoma - a growth containing bone, hair and teeth . WHAT ARE TERATOMAS? A teratoma is a tumour with tissue or organ components from more than one different part of the body. They have been reported to contain hair, teeth, bone and rarely more complex organs including eyes, hands, feet and limbs. In some cases a teratoma has been found to resemble a foetus. They are usually benign masses, though some cancerous forms of teratoma are known to exist. Mature teratomas, which are typically benign, are more commonly found in women. Immature teratoma, which are typically cancerous, are more often found in men. They are thought to be present at birth, but are often not discovered until later in life. Teratomas can occur in the testes in men and ovaries in women, as well as the brain, skull, nose, tongue, under the tongue and in the neck. WHAT ARE PINEAL TUMOURS? Pineal tumours are those that affect the pineal gland in the brain. The gland produces the hormone melatonin, which helps control sleeping. There are different types of pineal tumour, their name depending on the kind of cells from which they develop. The majority are germ cell tumours. Different tumours cause different symptoms. They are generally caused by a build-up of fluid in the brain, which leads to increased pressure, or caused the tumour itself. They include: . But tests revealed the mass was benign, and Miss Karanam is expected to make a full recovery in just three weeks. She said she wanted to raise awareness of Dr Shahinian's technique. 'This has to be mainstream,' she added. 'When they know you have a pineal tumour, they should tell you \"you know what? There's a minimally invasive approach in which they won't kill you, they won't leave you with a disability.' Prior to Dr Shahinian's keyhole approach, he said the only option was to remove half of the patient's skull to reach the tumour. He added: 'We want to be in and out without the brain knowing we were there, and I think that's the beauty of this technique.'", "reference": "Yamini Karanam, 26, was\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with a pineal brain tumour .\nSurgeons operating to extract the growth made a startling discovery .\nThey found a teratoma - an embryonic twin with bone, hair and teeth .\nTeratomas are often found in ovaries, testes but more rarely in the brain .", "pred_summary": "Plagued by a feeling something wasn't right, student Yamini Karanam sought medical help.\nShe was diagnosed with a pineal tumour in her brain."}

When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him \u2013 to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday \u2013 where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump\u2019s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at\u00a0Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump \u2013 In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.'

{"article": "Earlier this month, a pregnant Canadian weather presenter received hate mail from viewers 'grossed out' by her appearance on their screens. The scathing critics told the six-months pregnant meteorologist Kristi Gordon that her 'front end looks like the Hindenburg\u00a0and your rear end looks like a brick s***house.' Fans jumped to support her when Gordon read out excerpts from the letters and emails on TV, but it seems that abuse of pregnant TV presenters daring to get on with their jobs during their pregnancy is nothing new. Australian presenter and model Nicky Buckley famously soldiered on with her presenting job on The Sale of the Century after falling pregnant in 1997, continuing to wear the glamorous, figure-hugging gowns her job required of her. 'Never in my wildest dreams did I expect the barrage of abuse that was bestowed upon my unborn baby and me by a multitude of critics who were determined to dampen the joyous marvel of pregnancy,' Buckley, now 49, writes in her newly-released memoir. Scroll down for video . Pregnant and proud: Buckley copped heavy criticism for showing bump on TV but stood her ground . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia about the book, 'Nicky Buckley: A Memoir', she shared just how bad the criticism became. 'I was told I jammed fax machines at Channel 9 and newspapers - with faxes coming in from people commenting negatively.' 'At the time there wasn't any maternity wear except kaftans which covered you from head to toe, hiding your boobs and bump,' she said. Bitterness over bump: Buckley wore sexy dresses that revealed her bump, \u00a0shocking TV audiences, and hit back in magazine interviews saying she refused to bend to critics . TV Scandal: Nicky Buckley enraged public by staying on air throughout her nine month pregnancy . Family first: Buckley bucked preconceived notions of women in TV and continued to work to support family . As her role was to wear glamorous evening dresses and there wasn't adequate maternity wear available, she  just went up a size from her usual attire and got on with things. 'I wasn't out to raise the flag or cause a stir, I simply wanted to work \u2013 as was my right. Yet in doing so people had other opinions and thought I shouldn't be seen publicly with a bump.' 'I had a mortgage, people tend to forget  and put you in a bubble. But I still had a mortgage and do you think I should just stop and be taken off the air?' Game model: Game show host and model copped flack for her bump and continued to work to pay the bills . Glamorous to gritty: Despite her glamour role, Buckley says the pregnancy showed the ugly side to TV . 'I needed to pay the bills and I was happy with what's going on,' she said. 'Looking back I'm proud of how strong I was. I can't push the point hard enough, I was steadfast and strong, I was going to work and do my job.' 'I couldn't wait to share the news with my girlfriends but after the usual squeals of congratulations  they said \"what are you going to do about work?' she reflects in the book. A friend even made the shocking suggestion to Buckley that they could build her a podium to stand behind once she started to show. Host to husband: Buckley married her co-host Murray Bingham and subsequently had three children with him . While taken aback, she said she believes people saw her role as glamorous one and being pregnant clearly didn't fit with that image. 'Despite my blossoming belly and impending birth, unintentionally I had sparked a very public debate that divided a nation - was pregnancy  something to be ashamed of? Were pregnant women even attractive?  said Buckley. Not to mention the dress she wore on the runway at a Myer Fashion Festival that saw eyebrows raised. 'That caused a real stir. It was a dress with a cut out heart over the belly, people saw it outrageous but the designer and I thought it was beautiful and embraced the bump and fashion all at the same time.'

{"article": "An engineer, who was sentenced to six months jail and 75 lashes after he was found with homemade alcohol in Saudi Arabia, has spoken of his frustration with the lack of help he received from the Australian embassy. Grandfather Peter Mutty, from Roseberry in Sydney's inner-west, was caught with two cartons of beer, one box of red wine and one box of white wine in his car on August 31 last year while driving home in Riyadh. The possession of alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia. Sydney grandfather Peter Mutty (pictured with his wife, Debbie, and grandchildren) has had a travel ban placed on him after he served time for alcohol possession, which is illegal in Saudi Arabia . While other expats who had committed the same crime in the past were deported, Mutty was ordered to serve jail time according to the Islamic calendar and received 28 of the 75 lashes he was sentenced to have. He said it was not unusual for a reduction in penalty as the point of it was to 'humiliate' a person. The 57-year-old was sent to Thoqba prison in the Al Khobar Eastern Province on October 19 and was released on March 19. He shared the same cell with two murderers, a rapist and thieves. But since he walked free, Mutty has been unable to leave Saudi Arabia or work as he has been banned from travelling out of the country without any explanation as to why this is happening . Mutty's situation has turned so desperate that he and his wife, Debbie, have reached out to family to help them by donating money. He was jailed for six months and 75 lashes, but only received 28. Mutty says he received little assistance from the Australian embassy in Saudi Arabia . The Sydney grandfather does not deny he committed the crime, but he has grown increasingly frustrated with the Australian embassy who he claims have not been taking his case seriously. 'The Australian embassy, who made contact late in the piece with the [Saudi Arabia's] Foreign Ministry, said I would not receive lashes but I did. The whole thing is a complete stuff-up,' Mutty told Daily Mail Australia. 'We don't care what the politics are, [we want them to] take this seriously. An Australian citizen is not being treated fairly.' Mutty said the embassy should have helped him try and find out which department had placed the travel ban on him. 'We don't know who put the travel ban in place. [It could have been] the police, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the office of public prosecution,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'And we can't focus on the right person to lift this travel ban. 'That\u2019s what we're expecting the Australian embassy in Riyadh to do for us. They have to be much more proactive.' Mutty has grown so frustrated with the situation that he has gone public to drum up awareness. 'My own embassy didn't stand up for me and finally we went to Australian media and the embassy has now decided to do something,' he said. After speaking out about his situation to the Australia media, Mutty was now receiving assistance from the embassy . When asked why he had run the risk of getting caught, Mutty answered frankly: 'Because you get complacent. I never thought I would get caught. 'The way life works here for expats is all of us live on compounds and those compounds are secure,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'If you know someone on other compounds, you go to their compound in your car. '[After a barbecue], you take some food and some nibbles and some alcohol [back home], and every time you run the risk. 'It's very unusual expats get stopped by the police here... [but] on this particular day, we got stopped.' Despite his brush with the law in Saudi Arabia, Mutty said he would be willing to return and work in the country. 'I would have no problem coming back to Saudi Arabia to work,' he said. 'I knew the laws of the country. I signed a document that I understood the laws and alcohol ban was listed, so in other words I knew what I was doing and getting myself into.' A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Daily Mail Australia tey had been providing Mr Mutty with consular assistance. 'The Australian Embassy in Riyadh has been providing Mr Mutty with consular assistance in line with the Consular Services Charter from the time he first made contact seeking assistance on 10 September 2014. 'That assistance, which continues, has included visits to him in prison, to ensure his health and welfare were being appropriately safeguarded, and official representations on his case to senior Saudi authorities,' the spokesperson said. 'The Embassy is in contact with Mr Mutty and his legal representative about having the current travel ban lifted so that he can depart Saudi Arabia.'", "reference": "Grandfather Peter Mutty was caught with alcohol on August 31 last year .\nThe Sydney man was sentenced to six months jail and 75 lashes for crime .\nHe was released on March 19, but a travel ban prevents him from leaving .\nDue to this ban, Mutty is unable to work as an engineer in Saudi Arabia .\nHe has hit out at the Australian embassy who he says has not been helpful .\nSince speaking about his situation, Mutty said they were finally listening .", "pred_summary": "Sydney grandfather Peter Mutty sentenced to six months jail and 75 lashes after being found with alcohol in Saudi Arabia.\nThe 57-year-old claims the Australian embassy have not done enough to help him."}
{"article": "A 16-year-old boy has admitted trying to buy a biological toxin that is 30 times more deadly than ricin from undercover police on the 'dark web'. The teenager from Mossley, Greater Manchester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wanted to obtain abrin online. He was caught after an investigation was launched by the North West counter-terrorism unit in January. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods online without being found by traditional search engines . Today he pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court. He will be sentenced later this month for the offence, which is contrary to the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 and Section 1 of the Biological Weapons Act 1974.

Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website, and its successor that were recently shut down, was used to sell drugs in exchange for Bitcoins. Other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs, hacked information and credit card numbers. The investigation came after information was passed to law enforcement officers who were covertly in communication with the 16-year-old, who had expressed an interest in acquiring the poison on the dark web.

Ten days later, warrants were executed at two addresses in the Mossley area of Greater Manchester and the teenager was arrested.

{"article": "More than 3,000 students are facing an unexpected decision after they received acceptance notices from the University of Florida - only to find they would have to spend a year taking online classes. The 3,118 unidentified applicants were presumably delighted when they were accepted as freshmen by the university in Gainesville for the fall after sending in applications for traditional first-year slots. But after reading their congratulations notices, they apparently realized they would need to agree to spend their entire first year taking classes on the Internet in order to attend the public college. The classes are part of a new program - the Pathway to Campus Enrollment (PaCE) - which started in 2015 and aims to\u00a0accommodate a higher number of students,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reported. New program: More than 3,000 students are facing an unexpected decision after they received acceptance notices from the University of Florida (pictured) - only to find they would have to take online classes for a year . The students who were accepted to the university - on the basis they agreed to undertake online classes for a year - had not applied to the program, which will likely help expand enrollment in the university's new\u00a0$15million online undergraduate program, created by state legislators in 2013. They were also in addition to the estimated 12,000 students offered traditional freshman slots. Steve Orlando, senior director of UF's media relations, told the newspaper the move 'allows us to offer admission to additional qualified applicants with academic potential and demonstrated success'. Joe Glover, who has been the university's Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs since July 2008, added: 'The market for freshman is by no means clear anywhere in the country. 'We are trying different things to identify that market. That is one of the motivations.' On its website, UF says that PaCE helps deal with the 'limited space of campus' and gives students 'the chance to start [their] degree online and then transition to campus in order to complete it.' It adds it 'offers an excellent academic experience, combining online and campus-based learning'. New iniatitive: The classes are part of a new program - the Pathway to Campus Enrollment (PaCE, pictured) - which started in 2015 and aims to accommodate a higher number of students at the flagship university . Extending space: On its website , UF says that PaCE helps deal with the 'limited space of campus' and gives students 'the chance to start [their] degree online and then transition to campus in order to complete it' It tells students: 'Because of limitations to our freshman enrollment on UF's residential campus, we are unable to accommodate every capable student who applies to the university. 'However, because of your demonstrated potential, we are offering you a pathway to UF's residential campus different from our traditional transfer program.' With legislators keen to expand online learning at Florida universities, UF's online graduate program became available to students in 2014, with a huge $15million assigned to start-up and initial costs. But PaCE 'didn\u2019t fully exist' last fall for the 2016 admissions season, Mr Glover told the newspaper, describing the initiative as 'an experiment' that some of the 3,118 students may not wish to accept. Provost: Joe Glover (pictured), the university's Provost, said: 'The market for freshman is by no means clear anywhere in the country.'We are trying different things to identify that market. That is one of the motivations' He admitted that many parents were surprised to find their children had been accepted to UF on the condition they took online classes - and had bombarded him with calls asking questions about it. On its website, UF states that to be achieve a degree through the PaCE program, students must be willing to 'enroll for at least two semesters and a minimum of 15 credits through UF Online'. It adds: 'After earning a total of 60 credits and meeting program requirements, students may submit a transition form to move from online learning to a guaranteed place on the UF residential campus.' The program offers 60 majors in seven colleges, including psychology and telecommunication. Students in PaCE  receive a 25 per cent tuition discount, the website says. They will also not have to pay some of the fees required for residential students.", "reference": "3,118 applicants accepted as freshmen by University of Florida, Gainesville .\nBut after receiving acceptance notices, they realized there was a condition .\nStudents had to agree to spend their entire first year taking online classes .\nClasses are part of new program Pathway to Campus Enrollment, or PaCE .\nThey aim to accommodate more students at flagship college, officials said .", "pred_summary": "More than 3,000 applicants received acceptance notices from University of Florida.\nBut they were told they would have to take online classes for a year.\nNew program aims toaccommodate a higher number of students.\nStudents in PaCE receive a 25 per cent tuition discount."}
{"article": "Ephedra foeminea (pictured) waits for the full moon to bloom and produces a sugary droplet to attract pollinating insects . It may not turn into a bloodthirsty beast in the moonlight, but a peculiar plant does rely on the lunar cycle to survive. Called Ephedra foeminea, the plant waits for the full moon to 'bloom' and is the only plant species so far that\u2019s known to behave in this way. At night, the non-flowering relative of conifers secretes tiny droplets of sugary fluid to attract pollinating insects. They ooze from the plant\u2019s female organs where seeds are produced. When a nocturnal butterfly or insect lands on one of the tasty transparent orbs at night, the pollen it\u2019s carrying is used to fertilise the seed. Researchers from Stockholm University noticed the droplets at the same time of the year having conducted four years of research, New Scientist reported. When they went to study the plants in Macedonia, Greece and Dalmatia in Croatia in 2013, they were baffled as to why the orbs were not there, but after abandoning their field work to get some dinner, noticed that there was no moon this time. They checked data to see whether the creation of the globules coincided with the full moon and were shocked to find they did. Researcher Catarina Rydin said: \u2018It all fitted, and all we had to do was wait for 2014's full moon in July to see if that was what the plants were waiting for, and it absolutely was.\u2019 The study, published in Biology Letters, says: \u2018The exact timing of pollination in E. foeminea varied considerably from year to year, but was correlated with the full moon of July.\u2019 The study, published in Biology Letters, says: \u2018The exact timing of pollination in E. foeminea varied considerably from year to year, but was correlated with the full moon of July.\u2019 \u00a0A stock image showing the phases of the moon is pictured . Dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung. Badgers tend to raise their leg to urinate at full moon, to mark their territory before mating, LiveScience reported. Corals release huge amounts of sperm and eggs at full moon. By synchronising spawning, they increase the chances of eggs being fertilised. While lions hunt most effectively at night, they sometimes kill during the day when there's a full moon. Pets injure themselves more when the moon is full, although there is no reason why. A study found a 28 per cent increase in dog visits to the vets and 23 per cent increase for cats. \u2018To our astonishment, even cones that appeared too young to be pollinated\u2026 secreted pollination drops from a pore-shaped micropylar opening during the peaking period at full moon. \u2018One to two weeks earlier, when the moon was new and in its first quarter, we observed the exact opposite; drop secretion was weak to non-existent and pollinators were absent.\u2019 While the globules materialised on E. foeminea at full moon, the same was not true of a relative found in the area. It\u2019s unknown how the plant \u2018knows\u2019 when it\u2019s full moon, but they can detect different intensities of light during the phases of the moon as well as gravity, which they could potentially use to identify lunar phases. While E. foeminea may be the first plant to respond to the lunar cycle, numerous animals are known to experience behaviour changes at different times during the cycle. For example, dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung and crabs and seabirds are also said to use the moon to carry out daily activities. Ephedra foeminea is the only known plant species to follow the lunar cycle, but dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung (a stock image is shown) and crabs and seabirds are also said to use the moon to carry out daily activities . \u2018Correlation with the lunar cycle has been described regarding activity, reproduction, communication and navigation for a number of vertebrates and invertebrates,\u2019 the study says. \u2018Even eyeless animals such as reef corals correlate their reproduction with the phases of the moon. \u2018Therefore, it is not surprising that the moon can influence plants as well, e.g. as a consequence of plant\u2013animal interactions.\u2019 Dr Rydin said: \u2018To the best of our knowledge, this is a first. \u2018At night, the many pollination drops glitter like diamonds in the full moonlight, a spectacular sight also for the human eye.\u2019", "reference": "Ephedra foeminea waits for the full moon to produce nectar .\nExperts from Stockholm University studied plant in\u00a0Greece and Croatia .\nPlant's 'aim' is to seduce insects so they will fertilise its seed .\nIt's the only species that's known to follow the moon's phases\u00a0to survive .", "pred_summary": "Ephedra foeminea waits for the full moon to bloom and produces a sugary droplet to attract pollinating insects.\nIt is the only plant species so far that's known to behave in this way."}
{"article": "Foreign workers will have to pay an average of \u00a322,000 in tax before they can claim benefits under Tory plans to be unveiled this week. Migrants arriving in the UK will be banned from receiving handouts from the welfare state for four years, forcing them to pay tax and national insurance the state. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits . Under the proposals, unemployed EU migrants in Britain will be banned from receiving state support, and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving. For those in work, they would be barred from claiming handouts like housing benefit or tax credits until they have being in the UK for four years. It means a migrant workers on an average wage will pay \u00a322,600 in tax and national insurance over four years before they are able to receive state support. There will also be a ban on 'exporting' child benefit for children living in other EU countries. The crackdown was ordered after the government failed to meet David Cameron's target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands. Latest figures show that in the year to September, 298,000 more people arrived in the UK than left. Mr Cameron rowed back from plans to limit freedom of movement across the EU after a backlash from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But Mrs May today said the benefits changes would act to limit the appeal of coming to Britain from poorer parts of the EU. 'Our plan would remove a huge financial incentive for European migrants to come to Britain for the wrong reasons,' she told The Sun. 'Instead of claiming in-work benefits, under our plans the vast majority will pay into the system, contributing thousands of pounds.' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . She said the Tories had made the immigration system 'fairer and more effective' than it was in 2010, but more was needed. The Home Secretary said: 'That's why our manifesto, which will be published this week, will spell out our plan to negotiate a new deal with Europe. 'The changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be a key part of our renegotiation with the EU, and we will put our reform package to the British people in a straight in-out referendum by the end of 2017. 'Labour oppose this plan, as they have opposed all the steps we have taken to create a fairer immigration system since 2010. Ukip talk a lot about immigration - but they don't have a serious plan for action.' Under the plans, migrants with jobs will only receive in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and social housing once they have been in the UK for four years. And no child benefits or tax credits for children living elsewhere in Europe will be paid out, regardless of how long an EU migrant has paid into UK coffers under the plans. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed'. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed' She told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'The practical policies are that we want to make sure we have stronger border controls and that means having 1,000 more border staff to actually do proper checks to follow up on visas.' Labour, she added, would change the benefit rules so that people coming to Britain could not claim benefits until they had been in the country for more than two years. She said: 'It's not happening, what have they done in the last five years, they haven't dealt with it. And the thing that is different about our approach compared to any other party is we would deal with the exploitation by agencies, recruitment agencies and employers, who are exploiting immigration to undercut wages and jobs, that makes the system unfair. 'You've got some recruitment agencies who are recruiting from abroad, we would change the law, make exploitation a crime.' The Conservatives, she added, should not be trying to restrict overseas university students at the same time as 'doing nothing' about illegal immigration.", "reference": "Conservatives will ban in-work benefits for migrants for four years .\nUnemployed EU migrants deported if they do not get a job after six months .\nNet migration at 298,000, despite Cameron's pledge to cut to under 100,000 .", "pred_summary": "Foreign workers will have to pay an average of \u00a322,000 in tax before they can claim benefits.\nBan on 'exporting' child benefit for children living in other EU countries."}

Leia and Luke aren't seen in the trailer, but we hear Luke's unmistakable voice as he passes along a lightsaber, presumably to other Skywalker family members. Carrie Fisher also teased her new wardrobe, and promised no metal bikini. 4. There's less CGI than in the prequels . Abrams said he was proud that \"you can watch the movie and see what it is\" before the effects wizards at Industrial Light and Magic did their work. And yes, the new droid BB-8 (who was a fan favorite at the panel) is not CGI. 5. The ruins of the Empire are all around .

{"article": "America celebrated the coming of age of a new sporting hero on Sunday when Jordan Spieth, 21, showed true grace under pressure to win The Masters. As people clamor to find out about this humble champ from Texas, a letter penned six years ago when he was still in high school has surfaced which only reinforces his nice guy image. As a junior at Jesuit High School in Dallas, the grateful golfer wrote the letter to the Murphy family who had funded the scholarship that helped pay for his tuition. Scroll down for video . A letter of thanks penned by Masters champion Jordan Spieth six years ago when he was on a scholarship at Jesuit High School in Dallas, left, has surfaced which only reinforces his nice guy image . As a junior at Jesuit High School in Dallas, the PGA golfer was humble enough to write the letter to the Murphy family who funded the scholarship that helped pay for his tuition . In the thank you note, Spieth wrote that he earned the scholarship from a work grant program, reports The Dallas Morning News. Spieth, already dreaming about winning the Masters, was already an extremely talented golfer in 2009 and he casually informs the family that he's the No. 1 junior golfer in the country. The 21-year-old impressed many following Sunday's big victory with his manners and affable manor as well as his golfing skills. As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. He then went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. 'He's just a class guy in every way and it's difficult not to root for him,' said golf legend Phil Mickelson. Spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at Augusta National . Spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on . Spieth (right) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend Annie . Another legend impressed by Spieth was Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: 'Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. 'Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about him. He's polite, he's humble, he handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he's obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion.' The one family member who wasn't present to enjoy the celebrations was Jordan's 14-year-old sister Ellie, who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. The siblings regularly Facetime each other and every time they talk Ellie asks he brother if he has won yet. 'I'll finally be able to tell her yes,' he said, smiling. 'I know she was watching on television and I think she's going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green,' he said. 'She's going to want a present.' Spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister Ellie (centre) and brother Steven (right) Spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left-handed . Golf should not have been Spieth's game at all. Nobody in the family plays \u2014 they are all big basketball fans. But Spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there. When he set out he was ranked 809th in the world. Now he is No 2 behind Rory McIlroy. In 18 months, he has banked more than $13 million on the PGA Tour alone. In his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says: 'I don't see this as a great run of form, I see this as normal,' it does not come across as at all boastful.

{"article": "Photographer Seth Casteel's unique pictures of dogs swimming underwater managed to captivate an international audience, but now he has a new subject: babies. Casteel has found a remarkable new way to capture images of toddlers at their most playful and pure as they dive down into the deep during their first swimming lesson. The pictures for his new book, Underwater Babies, reveal adorable babies as they explore the underwater world, chubby-cheeked, curious, mischievous, and playful, all captured in his up-close-and-personal signature style. Scroll down for video . Super swimmer: Zoe Ubiera is five-months old and was one of 750 babies that Seth Casteel photographed . Caped crusader:\u00a0The babies also added their own flair with this one dressed in a cape and mask . Unsinkable: Seven-month-old Zelda calmly paddles along as Seth Casteel snaps away . Oceanic: Nine-month-old Khyleigh takes like a duck to water as she swims towards the camera . His pictures are innovative and take on an air of excitement as the youngsters swim beneath the waves. Casteel says he was drawn to create his new book, Underwater Babies after hearing of the shocking statistics of the numbers of children that drown. Kids between one and four have the highest rates of drowning than any group in the nation. 'The book is a celebration of babies, but there's definitely a serious element to it,' Casteel told Today.com. 'A big reason I wanted to make this book is to promote the cause of water safety for babies. I just want to let people know about the benefits of these classes and that they are something to strongly consider.' He created the book by heading along to water safety classes for babies at swimming pools in ten different states. He photographed around 750 babies in schools across each of the states to create Underwater Babies, which will be released on April 7. Acquatic: Michael, 12 months, explores underwater with his goggles on . Playful: Valentina, nine months, takes a dip underwater with her rattle . Under the sea: A seven-month-old named Ayla takes the plunge in a mermaid costume \u00a0in photographer Seth Casteel's new book, Underwater Babies . Serene: Casteel hopes to use the adorable photos of babies like 4 1/2 month old Michael to promote water safety for toddlers . 'I only had a limited window to really seize that moment in time because they can only go underwater just for a moment,' Casteel said. 'I could only take four or five pictures really quickly. Maybe the baby turned or there were bubbles or the instructor got in the way. I was never frustrated because that's the nature of it. You get what you get.' Apart from promoting his new 70-page book containing his creative pictures, Casteel said that he was eager to get the message across about water safety. He was spurred along after hearing a story about an 18-month old baby who drowned in a pool at a family reunion where over 40 people were present, yet the baby died after being left unattended. Floater: This 11-month-old named Warren is happy in the few moments he has beneath the pool's surface . Snapshot: Casteel often only had a second or two to capture the images of babies like Emerson who is 7 months old when they briefly went underwater . The babies in the pictures are being taught to 'self-rescue,' in which babies are taught to hold their breath underwater, kick their feet, turn over to float on their backs and rest until help arrives. The technique was pioneered in the late '60s by Harvey Barnett, who at 18 became determined to teach infants to swim after the drowning of a neighbor's child. His methods have spread around the world and are now taught in numerous clinics and imitated widely. Underwater Babies by Seth Casteel is published by Headline on 7th April at \u00a311.99.

{"article": "Bereaved families say the report is being dragged out so figures like Tony Blair can rebut its findings . The families of Britain\u2019s Iraq war dead expressed their disgust last night after learning the long-awaited official report into the conflict may be delayed yet again. Publication of Sir John Chilcot\u2019s inquiry, which began in 2009 and has cost the taxpayer almost \u00a310million, had already been pushed back until after the election. Yesterday it emerged it is unlikely to be published until next year at the earliest. Bereaved parents said they were disgusted that their suffering was being dragged out to give leading figures in the inquiry, like Tony Blair, the chance to rebut its findings. They added they were now expecting a whitewash when the report is finally published. Earlier this year it emerged the report, expected to criticise dozen of senior figures involved in the 2003 conflict, had been pushed back until after the election because it was too politically sensitive to publish so close to a national poll. But sources close to the investigation have now told BBC\u2019s Newsnight that \u2018nobody thinks it will come out this year\u2019. In comments that caused anger among military families, the sources suggested that \u2018once they had failed to meet the pre-election deadline, they gave up trying to speed things up\u2019. Further delays will fuel speculation that those criticised are trying to bury damning revelations. Last night Rose Gentle, whose son Gordon, 19, was killed in Iraq in 2004, told the Mail: \u2018I\u2019m actually disgusted. I now definitely do feel like I am being fobbed off. How long do we have to wait? It has been 11 years since Gordon died and they are dragging it out for all the families.\u2019 Reg Keys, whose 20-year-old son Tom died in 2003, said: \u2018We were told from Sir John that it would be a robust and thorough inquiry and we would get the answers we were looking for. This Chilcot inquiry is like an open wound and we need those answers. To have to wait until 2016 for them is just ridiculous.\u2019 Mr Keys, 62, added he thought the final report would likely be \u2018watered down\u2019. Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesman Tim Farron said speculation about a delay was \u2018deeply concerning\u2019. He added: \u2018Hundreds of thousands of families have had their lives torn apart by the Iraq War and deserve answers. It is simply not good enough for this process to be continually delayed and the report must be published.\u2019 The findings have been held up by the process of \u2018Maxwellisation\u2019 \u2013 giving individuals in the report a chance to respond. Newsnight\u2019s diplomatic editor Mark Urban said it had become a \u2018nightmare\u2019, with some of those criticised given drafts running to \u2018hundreds of pages\u2019. Delayed: Sir John Chilcot (pictured) began his inquiry in 2009. It has cost the taxpayer almost \u00a310million, with the findings unlikely to be published until next year at the earliest, it has emerged . Mr Blair has previously denied responsibility for hold-ups to the inquiry \u2013 which stopped taking evidence in 2011. But bereaved families say they are now expecting a whitewash when the report is finally published . Wrangling between the inquiry and Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood over the publication of Whitehall conversations and communications between Tony Blair and President George W Bush has also caused delays. Janice Procter, 53, whose son Michael Tench, 18, was one of the youngest to die, told the Mail: \u2018It is a total whitewash, I think the longer that it has gone, the longer it is giving people a chance to change their responses. It is all lies, lies, lies. I don\u2019t think anybody will get an answer from it.\u2019 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he was \u2018dismayed beyond belief that we are having to wait so long \u2013 and now, it is being reported, even longer than I had feared \u2013 to finally find out the truth of what happened.\u2019 Mr Blair has previously denied responsibility for hold-ups to the inquiry \u2013 which stopped taking evidence in 2011.

Residents of\u00a0Ansai, in Shaanxi Province, central China, said they could smell gas and petrol coming from the well, and blame a leak from a local petrol station, The People's Daily Online\u00a0reports. Villagers in\u00a0Ansai,\u00a0Shaanxi Province, in central China, dug a 46m well in order to get fresh drinking water, but when the pumped it to the surface the found it was so polluted it could be set on fire . Local officials say they have now launched an investigation into how the water from the well, which cost \u00a31,000 to build, became so polluted . Locals said they could smell \u00a0petrol when the water surfaced, and blame the pollution on a leak from a local gas petrol station, a claim which the owner denies . However, when Chinese officials investigated, they said they could find no trace of a spillage, leading some people to theorise that the villagers could have struck oil. However this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits only occur between 750 and 4,500m underground, and the well is only 46m deep. Tuo Zhijun, a villager in Ansai, said: 'Who knew when we turned on the pump, once the water was seeping through, everyone could smell gas and see oil slick.'

{"article": "Loretta Lynch was sworn in Monday as the 83rd U.S. attorney general, becoming the first African-American woman to serve as the nation's top law enforcement official. She said her confirmation as attorney general showed that 'we can do anything' and pledged to deal with cyberattacks and other threats facing the country. 'We can restore trust and faith both in our laws and those who enforce them,' Lynch said, an apparent reference to ongoing efforts to repair relations between police departments and minority communities. Scroll down for video . Vice President Joe Biden, accompanied by Loretta Lynch's father Lorenzo Lynch, second from left, and her husband Stephen Hargrove, second from right, administered the oath of office on Monday . 'We can restore trust and faith both in our laws and those who enforce them,' Lynch said, apparently referring to race-riot clashes between protesters and police . 'It seems like such an understatement to say my heart is full, but it is,' Lynch said. 'I have to thank the president for his faith in me and asking me to lead the department that I love to even greater heights.' Vice President Joe Biden administered the oath of office to Lynch at a Justice Department ceremony. Lynch replaces Eric Holder, who left the job Friday after six years as attorney general. The 55-year-old Lynch was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday following a months-long delay in which her nomination became caught up in a dispute over human trafficking legislation. 'Ladies and gentlemen, it's about time,' Biden said to applause. 'It's about time this woman is being sworn in,' he declared. 'We got tired of this wait.' 'But you showed such grace and such humility during this whole process,' he added, turning to America's newly minted top cop. Lynch paid an emotional tribute to her family during a brief speech after she took her oath. 'If a little girl from North Carolina who used to tell her grandfather in the fields to lift her up on the back of his mule so she could \"see way up high, Granddaddy\" can grow up to become the chief law enforcement officer of the United States of America, we can do anything.' She also outlined her hopes for the twilight months of the Obama presidency, saying she was driven by 'the desire to leave this world a better place for us having been a part of it.' 'The challenge in that \u2013 for you, for me, for all us that love this department and love the law \u2013 is to use the law to that end. To not just represent the law and to enforce the law, but to use it to make real the promise of America, the promise of fairness, the promise of equality, of liberty and justice for all.' Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, the senior senator from Lynch's home state of New York, gushed about her personal story on Monday. 'She is the ultimate professional: thoughtful, hardworking, keeps her nose to the grindstone, and is able to bring both sides together,' he said. 'On very difficult cases where police and community leaders were at loggerheads, she was able to bring both sides together and earn the trust and praise of both.' Biden slapped his former US Senate colleagues, saying it was 'about time' they confirmed Lynch . Eric Holder, who left his attorney general post on Friday, served in the job for more than six years . Schumer called her 'the American dream come true' and recalled that her mother picked cotton, 'so my daughter wouldn't have to.' Lynch, a former classmate of the future Michelle Obama, was previously the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, which encompasses much of New York City. She is expected to serve as the top federal law enforcement official for the remainder of the Obama administration. The outgonig attorney general, Eric Holder, said Friday during an emotional farewell at the Justice Department that his time in office would be seen as a 'golden age' in the department's history. Holder addressed hundreds of lawyers and staff members, saying, 'I am proud of you. I'm going to miss you. I am going to miss this building. I am going to miss this institution.'

{"article": "The family of a man who was cremated by mistake after a funeral home accidentally put a stranger's body in his coffin have filed a lawsuit. Jerry Moon's family only discovered the devastating blunder when they opened the casket to say their final\u00a0goodbyes and found the other body wrapped in a plastic bag. While the body of the loving father - who was terrified of cremation - was accidentally incinerated at Dahl McVicker Funeral Home\u00a0in Kelso, Washington State. The family of Jerry Moon, pictured with his wife Janice, were distraught when they found another man's body in his coffin . A lawsuit filed by the family claims the Brown Mortuary put the body of 97-year-old Robert Petitclerc in the coffin by mistake . The family is now seeking unspecified damages for emotional distress. Chronically ill in his final years, Mr Moon began arranging for his funeral 16 years before his death in 2013. The 72-year-old railroad conductor had paid $4,655\u00a0to be buried in a family plot in Chehalis, Washington, according to a lawsuit filed in Lewis County Superior Court. The prepaid services also included embalming, a funeral and a graveside service. After he passed away at a hospice in Longview on October 13,\u00a0the funeral home was responsible for transporting his body to the Brown Mortuary for a burial. But Shawn Briggs, an attorney representing Moon's family, said his identification bracelet had been placed on another body. Jerry Moon, pictured with at Weyerhaeuser Railroad where he worked for 28 years, was chronically ill in his final years and had began arranging for his funeral 16 years before his death in 2013 . Born in Chehalis, Mr Moon, a father and stepfather to six, spent most of his life in Southwest Washington . According to family members, Mr Moon's funeral was a touching goodbye to the man they loved. At the end of the service, they opened the casket. But they were horrified to find the body of\u00a0Robert Petitclerc - dressed in Jerry Moon's clothes and with a picture of Moon's wife tucked under the pillow in the coffin. Plastic had been wrapped round his head and face. 'This makes me feel like he was treated as a number, not a person,' daughter Cheryl Moon told KIROTV.com\u00a0at the time. 'I turned around and said to myself three times, 'That's not him, that's not him, that's not him,' son Randy Moon told the station. The mistake is all the more surprising as Mr Moon was 72 and bald while Mr Petitclerc was 97 and had a full head of hair, the lawsuit said. 'It was horrifying,' Mr Briggs told the Seattle Pi. The family, who had been given a bill of $8,834 by Brown Mortuary for the service, would only later learn that the mix up at the funeral home meant Mr Moon's had been cremated. Mr Moon, pictured with wife Janice, had paid $4,655 to be buried in a family plot in Chehalis, Washington, according to a lawsuit filed in Lewis County Superior Court . Grieving: Moon's son Randy says he believes his father is in Heaven, regardless of who was in the casket . Sadly the discovery was even more upsetting for the family as Mr Moon had always been scared of cremation. 'He was afraid of cremation,' Mr Briggs added.

{"article": "A red hot Novak Djokovic is being tipped to end Rafa Nadal's stranglehold at Roland Garros in June but the Spaniard dismissed the threat as being no different to those he has faced before. The Serbian world number one has been an unstoppable force in recent weeks, winning 17 matches on the bounce and becoming the first man to win the season's first three Masters title. He comfortably beat Nadal on his beloved red clay in last week's Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals, and the nature of Djokovic's 6-3 6-3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first French Open. Rafa Nadal practices in Barcelona as he steps up his clay-court preparation ahead of the French Open . Nadal was beaten convincingly by Novak Djokovic in MOnet Carlo last week . But as far as Nadal is concerned, 2015 is no different to 2013, 2012 or even 2011. 'Djokovic was good in 2011, in 2012, 2013 as well as in 2015. Sometimes you win more and some you win less,' Nadal, who has triumphed at the French Open in nine of the last 10 years, told reporters at the Barcelona Open. 'It is difficult to win everything all the time. Djokovic was as good then in 2011 as he is now. He had an impeccable year in 2011 as well as he is having in 2015. I have to congratulate him.

'The rest of the players have to accept that at the moment he is the world number one with all he has achieved this year,' added Nadal, who has had a patchy year after making his comeback in January following another lengthy injury and illness break. 'This year I have to do things right, get back to a very high level to face him on the court,' Nadal said. 'Tennis-wise, I feel a lot better than a few weeks ago.

{"article": "Everton midfielder James McCarthy believes Ross Barkley is more than capable of handling the highs and lows which accompany the tremendous expectation which rests on his shoulders. The 1-0 victory over Southampton, courtesy of captain Phil Jagielka's fifth goal of the season, was a case in point. In the first half he produced a brilliant piece of control and skill to skip past three opponents and launch an attack from deep inside his own half which brought Goodison Park to its feet. Everton midfielder James McCarthy believes Ross Barkley is capable of handling the pressure on him . McCarthy (left) said he thought Barkley was 'different class' despite a mistake with an ambitious pass . However, when his ambitious pass after the break gifted possession to the visitors the all-too familiar sound of loud groans echoed around the ground. Then, to cap it all, manager Roberto Martinez's decision to replace him with 20 minutes to go - a requirement to help shore up a tight game - was greeted with disagreement and boos. It is difficult to know what Barkley, who was lauded for two substitute appearances for England in the last 10 days, thought of it, but McCarthy is confident the youngster can deal with the complexities and confusion which appear to surround most of his performances. 'I think Ross was different class,' he said. 'I thought he worked really hard for the team and was a real nuisance driving at people and it was brilliant to see him high in confidence having been away with England. Barkley was withdrawn with 20 minutes to go at Goodison Park, a decision that brought boos from the crowd . 'Ross is a good lad and has his feet firmly on the ground and has a lot of people at the club looking after him. 'He won't get carried away. We have a lot of characters, a lot of experienced heads in the dressing room and there is no better place to be for him.' Aside from Jagielka's 16th-minute goal, giving the centre-back his best tally in eight years at the club, the only other notable action saw goalkeeper Tim Howard claw away Graziano Pelle's early shot from under his crossbar and throw out a hand, while diving the wrong way, to stop James Ward-Prowse's strike. Everton achieved what they were unable to do earlier in the season and ground out victory to make it three successive wins, moving them to 11th in the table, with the relegation fears of a couple of weeks ago now a thing of the past. With nothing to play for in their remaining seven matches McCarthy believes the motivation is to remain unbeaten until the end of the campaign. McCarthy is confident youngster Barkley can deal with the complexities of his sometimes indifferent form . 'We want to kick on, go on a winning run and finish the season strongly,' he added. 'We have won three games and we want to go unbeaten until the end of the season, although that is easier said than done. 'There has been a big improvement. So far, so good, but we won't get carried away. 'The most important thing was to get three points and dig in deep to secure it with a clean sheet.' With leading scorer Romelu Lukaku not quite ready to return after a hamstring injury, the onus was on other players to step up, but few would have bet on Jagielka being the match winner against Saints. Everton secured a 1-0 victory over Southampton, courtesy of captain Phil Jagielka's fifth goal of the season . 'He is different class. He is brilliant to have at the club and is a true leader on the pitch,' said McCarthy. 'A lot of people have been saying the last few weeks he has been exceptional, but for me he has been outstanding throughout the campaign and he is chipping in with goals.' Southampton boss Ronald Koeman conceded his side's Champions League hopes were now over, but was still keen to secure European football next season.

{"article": "Jack Colback admits Newcastle United's supporters are being left short-changed as the club's sorry season threatens to plunge new depths. The 25-year-old says he is already looking forward to next term given the slump in form which has seen the Magpies lose five on the spin and score just one goal in eight hours. But before this season is out Colback and his team-mates will have to endure planned protests with a boycott of Sunday's match against Spurs set to see thousands stay away from St James\u2019 Park. Jack Colback (left) says the Newcastle United fans deserve more following another disappointing defeat . Newcastle lost six in a row at the same stage 12 months ago and the atmosphere inside the ground was toxic during the final home game as fans targeted manager Alan Pardew and owner Mike Ashley. One year on and John Carver\u2019s threadbare squad is in real danger of being sucked into a relegation scrap should their ruinous run continue. And Colback accepts that their current effort is far from the standard required. The midfielder was one of the only players who deserves credit this season and put in a shift against Liverpool . \u2018This is a huge club which deserves more than it is getting at the moment,\u2019 said the midfielder, who was part of another lacklustre display during Monday\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Liverpool. \u2018It\u2019s a difficult situation we\u2019re in \u2013 we\u2019ve not got a lot of players. \u2018But we can\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves. We\u2019ve got to make sure we perform this weekend. \u2018If we play like we did in spells (at Liverpool) then we can pick up the wins we need to get this season out of the way and look to progress next year.\u2019 Carver says Ashley has promised him that the squad will undergo major renovation work this summer. Moussa Sissoko was sent off for a terrible tackle on Lucas Leiva to add to John Carver's woes . The head coach has raised concerns about the character of the players after they lost a fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby last weekend. But Colback said: \u2018The character is there in the team, even though we didn\u2019t show it last week (at Sunderland). \u2018We had to show a reaction at Liverpool because last week was nowhere near good enough. \u2018The minimum we could do is be better than the last game and I thought we were. \u2018We should have done better with their first goal and it was a shame we took until then to react. We created the odd chance. \u2018The penalty decision (Ayoze Perez was fouled by Dejan Lovren with the score at 1-0) was massive, it might have been a different game if we\u2019d got that. Nothing seems to be going our way at the moment. Ayoze Perez (centre) was denied a stonewell penalty by under-fire referee Lee Mason in the first half . \u2018But we\u2019re not going to get any sympathy, we\u2019ve still lost the game.\u2019 Carver, meanwhile, will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save the season.

De Jong \u2013 who has made just one Premier League start \u2013 was expected to miss the remainder of the campaign given that it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem. However, the 26-year-old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for United\u2019s reserves when they entertain Derby County this evening.

Boasting front and rear lights, rear view mirrors and even a car horn, the team behind the electric Babel Bike say it is unprecedented in its approach to safety. And perhaps most noticeable of all is the roll cage that surrounds the cyclist - keeping them safe against trucks and buses turning into them. Scroll down for video . London-based designer claims to have made the world's safest bike. Called the Babel Bike it has a host of features including a roll cage. Crispin Sinclair (shown with the bike) is seeking \u00a350,000 of funding on site Indiegogo. The bike also has foot protectors and an electric motor . The Babel Bike was designed by London-based Crispin Sinclair - son of the famous British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, whose 1985 Sinclair C5 bike turned out to be somewhat of a flop. Crispin will be hoping a similar fate does not befall his invention though - and hopes the array of safety features will appeal to safety-conscious cyclists. He is seeking \u00a350,000 ($74,000) of funding on Indiegogo to bring his dream to fruition. The price might be a bit much for some, with the non-electric version retailing for \u00a32,499 ($3,693), and the full electric version \u00a33,499 ($5,170). Both are \u00a3500 ($740) less if bought through Indiegogo. May 2016 is the estimated delivery date for the bike at the moment. The bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back, with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike\u2019s innards. It doesn\u2019t rely on pedal power alone, but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the US and 15.5mph in the EU. \u2018In both the US and the EU you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor can\u2019t assist at higher speeds (by law),\u2019 the team notes on their Indiegogo page.

Second-seed Nadal had easily seen off Nicolas Almagro in the previous round but found himself in trouble against Fognini, who had won in three sets in their previous meeting on the clay of Rio earlier this year. And on the same surface in front of Nadal's home crowd, it was Fognini who took the opening set 6-4 after a crucial break in the latter stages, though the second set was to prove an even tighter affair. Rafael Nadal was dumped out of the Barcelona Open after losing to Italian Fabio Fognini in the third round . In front of a home crowd, the world No 4 was looking for his ninth career title on the Catalan clay court . Fognini was able to save six break points in the opening game before conceding it to Nadal, though neither player really dominated even as the Spaniard went 4-2 up. After Fognini first fought back to 4-4, the set eventually went to a tie-break with Nadal this time having to work his way back from facing match point at 6-3 to level up. Nadal showed his resolve late on but it was Fognini who eventually won through 8-6, with his opponent missing a relatively routine forehand. It was Fognini's first win in his six Barcelona appearances but he will now face Pablo Andujar, who also caused an upset in coming through 6-3, 6-4 against fifth-seed Feliciano Lopez. Nadal, who was denied his 20th win of the season, cut an extremely disappointed figure after his defeat, going so far as terming it 'a disaster'. In quotes published on the Barcelona Open website, the world No 4 said: 'My game was mundane. I didn't have enough power, speed and control in my forehand. I didn't manage to push Fognini back. Fognini edged a hard-fought encounter 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) to move into the quarter-finals of the Barcelona Open . 'Fabio played better and he deserved to win. I did not deserve to win. That's why I will accept the upcoming challenges. I will work hard until I get back to my best. But it will be a while. 'It's a very sad day for me.

It seems likely that Mr Cameron was trying to avoid the fate of Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was much mocked for his attempt to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year .

We showed great maturity and quality and that\u2019s 12 goals in out last three games. \u2018To be on 85 points is sensational. If we win one more and get to 88 that will be a magnificent season.

{"article": "A husband has penned a moving essay celebrating his wife and everything she does for their family as a stay-at-home mother. Steven Nelms writes in the essay's introduction that he can't afford his wife to be a stay-at home. 'I don't at all mean to offend anyone with this post,' he writes. 'I'd like to explain exactly what that means so that no one thinks I'm in any way devaluing Stay-At-Home Moms.' Steven Nelms penned a moving essay celebrating his wife and everything she does for their family as a stay-at-home mother to their two-year-old son Ezra . 'On the contrary, I mean that I quite literally cannot afford my wife to be staying at home.' Nelms told the Independent Journal Review\u00a0that his wife, Glorianna, stays at home with the couple's two-year-old son Ezra because of high child care costs. But Nelms said working has always been a part of Gloriana's life, who had been employed since she was 14 and was contributing to her family's income when she was 17. 'Getting a paycheck was significant part of feeling valued and appreciated for all the hard work she did to provide for herself and help her family,' he sad. So Nelms, from Plano, Texas, decided to write an essay, which was posted on We Are Glory, in which he would break-down the monetary value of everything his wife does to care for the family. 'Yes, my wife is my son\u2019s mother and it is a natural result of being a parent to love and care for your own child,' he writes. 'There is also a very quantifiable dollar amount that can be attributed to the services rendered.' 'I am in no way trying to simplify, objectify, or devalue the priceless love of a mother for her child,' he wrote. 'But let\u2019s be real. Pay day feels good for a reason. Because you\u2019re seeing your hard work appreciated in a tangible way that lets you \u201ctreat yo self\u201d'. In the essay Nelms says he 'can't afford' his wife to be a stay-at-home mother, and then breaks down the monetary value of all that she provides.\u00a0'I would have to make over $100k to even begin to be able to cover my living expenses as well as employ my wife as a Stay-At-Home Mom!' he writes . Nelms said that he felt 'ashamed' for every time his wife felt she didn't have 'as much right to our income as I do' and that his income 'doesn't even come close to covering what she does for our family' Nelms estimates that the childcare his wife provides is worth $36,660 a year, the annual-salary for a full-time nanny. He also estimates this his wife does $5,200 worth of cleaning a year, $12,480 of cooking, and $13,520 for buying groceries and running errands. After adding that his wife helps deal with the family's finances and does the laundry, he concludes that his wife's annual salary should be $73,960. 'I would have to make over $100k to even begin to be able to cover my living expenses as well as employ my wife as a Stay-At-Home Mom!' he writes. 'In short, I can\u2019t afford for my wife to stay at home. And I\u2019ve tragically failed to show my wife the appreciation that she deserves.' Nelms admits in the essay that he has felt 'ashamed' every time he has ever made his wife feel guilty of humored when she has bought something for herself. 'I am ashamed that she has ever felt like she doesn't have just as much right to our income as I do. The fact of the matter is that our income doesn't even come close to covering what she does for our family.' 'She loves me, loves our son, and loves our family, so obviously she isn\u2019t doing any of those things for a paycheck or even for recognition.' 'But it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt to know that as a Stay-At-Home Mom her appraised salary is nearly double my actual income.' Nelms concludes the essay by telling his wife 'you are more precious than rubies.'

Love you Amelia & thank you for making me feel so happy inside and out @ameliafreer #eatnourishglow' In a previous interview with the Guardian in which Sam was described has having an appearance like an, 'HGV driver,' he said he would always struggle with his weight - despite his recent triumphs over the scales. Freer is an advocate of cutting out gluten and sugar (apart from fruit), processed food is a big no-no and every meal should include protein, fat and vegetables. She is against cereal and even recommends tucking into broccoli for breakfast. Almond milk, avocados and coconut oil are staples of her kitchen cupboards.

He also admitted that he was self conscious about his body type, adding: 'I'm always going to have issues with my weight.' He also revealed in the interview that he felt that he had failed to become successful as a teenager because of his size.

Sam has been seen out and about in recent months showing off his weight loss in some stylish outfits . Sam posted this picture of a delicious and healthy looking meal to Instagram after taking a nutritionists advice on his diet .

Take, for example, DJ Calvin Harris who is practically unrecognisable from the straggly haired performer he once was. Over recent years the 31-year-old Scot, who is currently thought to be dating Taylor Swift, has got a smooth new haircut and a muscular physique. Sam's new look is certainly earning plaudits from fans. When he revealed his weight loss, one commented the picture: 'Hi Sam, you look really good! Keep up the good work.' And another said: 'You always look good and you are an awesome singer!'

{"article": "Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed details about her experience with abortion, admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure. The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007\u00a0I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in\u00a0the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn\u2019t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn\u2019t that much more, but when you\u2019re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely\u00a0unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named\u00a0Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the\u00a0Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from\u00a02011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012,\u00a0858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children \u2014\u00a0she has an 8-year-old step-daughter\u00a0and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer\u00a0Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'", "reference": "The actress, 29, says she had to pay out of pocket for her 2007 abortion because she couldn't tell her mother .\nJemima says she was only able to afford the procedure by forgoing anesthesia, which would have made it more expensive .\nIn the Center for Reproductive Rights video, the star says she worries about the obstacles her young daughters may face in the future .", "pred_summary": "'I just didn't think it was fair' says Jemima Kirke.\nThe actress spoke out in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights."}

Three weeks later, Drogba scored again against Arsenal, this time securing a 1-0 win in the Premier League . Drogba (right) scored both goals as Chelsea came from behind against Arsenal to win the League Cup 2-1 .

Having originally signed for Chelsea in 2004 for a fee of \u00a324million from Marseille, Drogba took time to forge his redoubtable status against Wenger, his first two appearances ending goalless. It was the 2005 Community Shield when he first put Arsenal to the sword, lashing two goals past Jens Lehmann in a 2-1 victory at the Millennium Stadium before scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory in the Premier League three weeks later. In 2007, Drogba overturned the one-goal advantage Arsenal had in the 2007 League Cup final through Theo Walcott with another brace, again in Wales. And Drogba's third double against Arsenal was in similar circumstances on March 23, 2008. Bacary Sagna gave The Gunners the lead before Drogba struck twice in nine minutes at Stamford Bridge. The 2009 FA Cup semi-final allowed Drogba to break Arsenal's hearts again with silverware in sight, this time at Wembley. Like the 2007 League Cup final, Walcott put Arsenal ahead but Florent Malouda equalised before Drogba won the cup tie with a goal in the 84th minute. In the next two encounters between the London sides, Drogba netted a double in each game to lead Chelsea to a 3-0 and 2-0 victory respectively. On October 3 2010, he opened the scoring as Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-0 at Stamford Bridge which was his last goal against Arsenal in Chelsea colours.

{"article": "A Roma gang accused of selling a newborn  to a childless couple for \u00a36,500 and a car has told a French court that the child was 'a gift' Four Roma men and women appeared in a Marseille court today, accused of human trafficking and being involved in several similar 'baby sales'. Six others are facing related charges in what prosecution documents described as 'a two thousands piece puzzle built around four births'. Human trafficking: Carmen and Mike Gorgan, pictured speaking to their lawyer in the courtroom of Marseille's Criminal Court today, are accused of paying a Roma gang\u00a0\u00a36,500 and a BMW for newborn baby boy Tony . At the centre of the scandal was Ilie Ionita, a 35-year-old Romanian, and co-conspirators Valeriu Rosu, 42, Florian Stan, 33, and Florin Coman 25. All face up to 10 years in prison and fines equivalent to more than \u00a31million. They deny the charges against them, saying the babies were 'a gift'. The only defendant not in court was Fana Moses, the 32-year-old mother of the baby boy called Tony whom the gang sold. In July 2013, Marseille detectives received an anonymous tip that a Romanian woman had just given birth and had given the child to Mike and Carmen Gorgan, aged 27 and 28. The four accused Roma gang members\u00a0deny the charges against them, saying the babies were 'a gift' Both were accused of 'complicity in human trafficking', but their lawyer, Patrick Gontart, insisted: 'They do not believe they have done anything wrong'. The Roma gang was arrested as they prepared to board a flight from Italy back to Romania. At first all denied that money or good had been exchanged, but it was quickly established that Mr Gorgan had handed over 9000 euros(\u00a36,565) and the BMW to Ionita. Mr Gontart said: 'For a month and a half, Carmen behaved like Tony's mother and was very well treated.' He said the couple had 'fallen into the trap of many European couples. These are good people who are now unhappy because their child has been placed in a home.' Documents including identity cards were falsified to try and make it look like the parents who bought the baby were the biological mother and father. They had been trying for children unsuccessfully for ten years, the court heard. At least three other cases of babies being sold were then tracked down, both on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica and on the mainland. In all, two boys were sold, while other transactions broke down. All of the children are now back with their biological mothers, or else have been taken into care by social services. OICEM, the organisation against modern slavery, is a civil party in the case \u2013 one which it says highlights the growing problem of poor immigrants offering children for sale. Referring to baby Tony's case, OICEM director Nagham Hriech said: 'There was canvassing, exchange and even negotiations.'The case, which is expected to last two days at Marseille Correctional Court, continues.", "reference": "Roma gang 'sold' newborn baby to childless French couple in 2013 .\nGang received \u00a36,500 and a car, but claims the boy was a 'gift'\nFaked ID to make it look like Frenchwoman was baby's mother .", "pred_summary": "Roma gang accused of selling baby to couple for \u00a36,500 and a car.\nLawyer for couple say they 'fell into the trap of many European couples'"}

It would be wonderful to see more girls playing chess, and at a higher level, but rather than fretting about inequality, perhaps we should just gracefully accept it as a fact.\u2019 His comments mirror those of his rival Garry Kasparov, who infamously said: \u2018Women, by their nature, are not exceptional chess players: they are not great fighters.\u2019 Female chess players reacted angrily to Mr Short\u2019s statements last night.

{"article": "Dundee boss Paul Hartley has warned that Paul McGowan may not feature in any of the team's remaining six games this season because he fears playing the troubled midfielder could see him break his police curfew and end up in prison. After his third conviction last week for assaulting a police officer, McGowan escaped a jail sentence but was placed under a restriction of liberty order and confined to his home from 7pm to 7am for 16 weeks. That has already ruled him out of the evening matches with Celtic at Dens Park on Wednesday and at Parkhead on Friday May 1, but Hartley fears that even playing in the three remaining games in the City of Discovery, which kick off at 3pm, could leave the player at risk of breaching his order. Dundee rogue Paul McGowan has been handed his third conviction after assaulting a police officer . Dundee manager Paul Hartley says he will not risk playing the troubled midfielder again this season . Hartley is worried that if McGowan was, for example, called up for after-match drug testing, required hospital treatment for an injury or was caught in traffic on the 80-mile journey back to his home in Coatbridge, he would run perilously close to his 7pm curfew. And he admits the only game in which McGowan would be able to safely feature is the final-day derby at Tannadice which kicks off at 12.30pm on May 24, but even then he may not be risked. 'Paul McGowan is available for selection but there is no guarantee he will play,' conceded Hartley yesterday. 'He has a curfew and we don't want him to break it. 'This is something I will need to look at between now and the end of the season. And we need to look at all aspects of this - where he is playing, what time he will leave after the match, travelling times and whether he gets an injury. 'There are all sorts of things that could happen. Heavy traffic, or his car could break down, or he could be called in for drug testing - which can often take a long time. 'Paul stays in the central belt so there are times when the journey could take longer than an hour and a half. And the last thing we want to see is Paul getting into trouble because he misses his time zone. 'The last game of the season is definitely one he can play in because of the early kick off. We've not asked (the courts) for any special dispensation. But it's something we might look at.' McGowan has been fitted with an electronic tag on his ankle and, if selected by Hartley, it's understood the match-day referee would need to inspect the device before each game to ensure there are no health and safety risks. Law 4 in the Laws of the Game states: 'A player must not use equipment or wear anything that is dangerous to himself or another player (including any kind of jewellery).' Hartley said: 'There's been a suggestion that he can't play with the current tag he has got but I am sure he could. I've seen it happen before in English football and it's something we've been looking into. We are just waiting for confirmation.' Meanwhile, Dundee have agreed a pre-contract to sign Aberdeen midfielder Nicky Low on a three-year deal. The 23-year-old had been a peripheral figure at Pittodrie. Dons boss Derek McInnes told the Aberdeen official website: 'The option to sign an extended contract with a fellow Premiership club was one which Nicky felt he couldn't turn down.'

{"article": "Sir Bruce Forsyth has spoken out in favour of assisted dying, saying that watching his first wife suffer with dementia has convinced him he wants to 'die with a bit of dignity left'. The veteran entertainer, now 87, said people should not be 'left to suffer', adding that in many cases it could be 'more cruel to do nothing' than allowing them to die. Sir Bruce's first wife, Penny Calvert, was moved into a care home with dementia in 2008, and he visited regularly to help care for her until her death last year. Scroll down for video . Sir Bruce Forsyth has said that sometimes it can be 'more cruel to do nothing' than to let someone die, as he spoke out today in support of assisted dying . Sir Bruce said his experience of nursing first wife Penny Calvert (pictured here with the couple's three children) as she suffered with dementia had convinced him of a need for a change in the law . He said: 'It's a terrible illness, awful to see and awful for everyone close to the person suffering. 'It\u2019s a very difficult situation. She didn\u2019t remember me. It\u2019s just so awful to have your mind and your memories taken away from you. 'It bothers me an awful lot that people are just left to suffer. If I had Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia I would do something about it. 'The law should be changed and if people want to die with a bit of dignity left they should be able to do so. 'If it is what the person wants and it can be proved they are living a life of suffering it can be more cruel to do nothing. I\u2019d like that right for myself.' Sir Bruce married Ms Calvert in 1953, and the couple had three children together before splitting 20 years later. He then went on to marry Anthea Redfern, the hostess on the Generation Game, followed by Wilnelia Merced, a former Miss World who he married in 1983. While Sir Bruce (left) separated from Ms Calvert (right) in 1973, the two remained in contact, and he helped to secretly nurse her after she was taken into a home in 2008, until she died last year . Sir Bruce (pictured left with third and current wife\u00a0Wilnelia Merced, and right after receiving his knighthood) said he would like the right to be able to end his life 'with a bit of dignity left' Despite these new relationships, he remained on good terms with Ms Calvert, and supported her through her illness. Sir Bruce joins other celebrities and politicians who support assisted dying, including the late author Terry Pratchett, former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey, and Labour peer Lord Falconer. The latter has already tabled a bill asking that patients with less than six months to live be allowed to take their own life with the help of a doctor. However, the proposed change in the law has proved controversial, with distinguished judge Baroness Butler-Sloss saying it would 'cross a line' towards euthanasia. Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have also spoken out against assisted dying in the past. Under the 1961 Suicide Act, those who deliberate assist or encourage others to commit suicide can be sentenced to up to 14 years in prison. However, in 2010, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, issued guidelines making clear that anyone who assists a loved one who has reached a 'settled and informed' decision while 'acting out of compassion' is unlikely to be charged, leading to ambiguity.", "reference": "Sir Bruce said it can be 'more cruel to do nothing' than to let someone die .\nSaid he would like the right to be able to chose the timing of his own death .\nHe cared for first wife Penny Calvert after she was moved into care in 2008 .\nMs Calvert, whom he divorced in 1973, died in 2014 after battling dementia .", "pred_summary": "The veteran entertainer said people should not be 'left to suffer'\nHe said that in many cases it could be'more cruel to do nothing' than to let someone die.\nSir Bruce's first wife, Penny Calvert, suffered with dementia until her death last year.\nHe joins other celebrities and politicians who support assisted dying."}
{"article": "Sale's hopes of qualification for next season's European Champions Cup were dealt a hammer blow as they went down to a surprising 25-23 defeat at the Madejski Stadium. Sale still remain in seventh position but they lost ground on most of their rivals and have only themselves to blame for this disappointing result as they made too many critical errors. Irish scored three tries through Alex Lewington (two) and Andrew Fenby with Chris Noakes adding two penalties and two conversions. Sale Sharks winger\u00a0Tom Arscott dives over for a try during the first-half at the Madejski Stadium . Tom Arscott scored a brace of tries for Sale as Mike Haley claimed the other with Danny Cipriani kicking two penalties and a conversion. Prop, Richard Palframan, made his first Premiership start the hosts with Jebb Sinclair recalled in the back row. Shane Geraghty was an absentee with Chris Noakes included at fly-half and Fergus Mulchrone in the centre. Scott Steele was a late withdrawal after failing a fitness test with Darren Allinson coming in at scrum half. Sale's starting line-up was unchanged from their win over Gloucester but hooker, Marc Jones, returned on the bench. Exiles centre\u00a0Eoin Griffin is tackle by Sale powerhouse\u00a0Sam Tuitupou . Straight from the kick-off, Irish made simple errors, giving the visitors a platform to attack and with Cipriani pulling the strings, Sale created an overlap providing Arscott with an easy run-in. Irish missed an early opportunity for points by declining to take a kickable penalty and it proved the wrong option as their attacking line-out failed to provide any dividend. Irish suffered a blow when they lost lock Richard Skuse to injury with Luke Narraway coming on as his replacement. The opening period was played at a frenetic pace with Irish struggling to cope as Sale were all action, moving the ball at every opportunity, displaying some extremely slick handling. However against the run play, Irish produced an excellent movement with Allinson, Narraway and Fergus Mulchrone all prominent and they succeeded in winning a penalty, which Noakes kicked to leave his side trailing 5-3 at the end of the first quarter. Noakes then rewarded a period of pressure from Irish to kick his second penalty as it was now the turn of the visitors, to make the elementary errors. Sale were also conceding a number of penalties at the scrum area and from one of these, Noakes should have put Irish further ahead but his attempt was off target. Sale scrum half\u00a0Chris Cusiter attempts to make a clearance kick under pressure from the Exiles defence . After 33 minutes, Irish prop, Tom Court, was sin-binned for dragging down a driving line-out and Sale took immediate advantage when Haley outflanked the Irish cover defence to score a well-created try. With the last kick of the half, Noakes attempted a penalty from inside his own half. It fell short but for some inexplicable reason, Cipriani chose to run the ball from within his own 22 and his pass to Haley was fumbled by the full back. Irish capitalised with Fenby seizing the loose ball to race away for the try, which Noakes converted for a 13-10 interval lead. Tomas O'Leary and Griffin contest for a high ball during a frenetic Aviva Premiership contest in Reading . Court returned but Irish were soon back down to 14 men when Blair Cowan was yellow carded for a deliberate offside with Cipriani making no mistake with the resulting kick to tie up the scores. Sale took further advantage of Cowan's absence to score their third try and Arscott's second. The wing again outflanked the home cover but the scoring pass from Haley looked suspiciously forward. Irish fought back and they appeared to have scored when a driving maul crashed over the visitors' line but the TMO was unable to confirm the grounding. It did not matter for long as Sale's Chris Cusiter was yellow carded which give Irish a hance to score their second through Lewington. Topsy Ojo was the next to receive a yellow card, this one for dangerous play but Irish overcame this setback when Lewington brushed aside some weak tackling to score his second. Noakes converted to give Irish a 25-20 lead at the end of the third quarter.

Kevin Perz, 56, a father-of-four and business owner, has been looking up the teachers he has the fondest memories of from his days at Parkway Central High School in Chesterfield, Missouri. Over the past few years he has been mailing them a 'gift'. It started in 1992, when he sent a check to his calculus teacher made out for $5,000. Then in 2002, he sent a $10,000 check to his former business teacher. Huge gesture: Kevin Perz, 56 (right), a father-of-four and business owner, has been looking up the teachers he has the fondest memories of  mailing them a 'gift'.

Perz (left) recently sent Marilyn Mecham (right), his home economics teacher in 1977, a check for $10,000 . However the person he really wanted to surprise - his home economics teacher - was the hardest to find, because Perz only knew her as Mrs Mecham. Perz enlisted the help of the Alumni Association, who went through decades-old board room minutes. They were then able to uncover the name for Perz - Marilyn Mecham. From there, Perz was able to find a phone number for Mecham's son, who he called and asked for her information. Perz then called Mecham and told her how long it took him to get to that point. 'I was so appreciative to have somebody spend all that time looking for you to tell that you meant so much in their life,' Mecham told ABC News. Mecham was moved by the call, and took to her Facebook profile to urge others to reach out to someone who had impacted their lives. Flashback: Marilyn Mercham (left) was in her first year of teaching when she had Perz (right) as a student at\u00a0Parkway Central High School in Chesterfield, Missouri, in 1977 . Kind: Perz said he felt it important to show the people who had impacted his life how grateful to them he is . However that wasn't the end of it. Two days later she received a handwritten letter from Perz, reiterating what he had told on the phone. Attached to the letter was a check for $10,000. Perz had written he would be 'sad' if Mecham didn't spend it all on herself. 'She called me Monday - she said she got it Friday and she spent the whole weekend crying,' Perz told ABC News. 'Everybody in their life can always think back to someone in their life who had an impact, if it's a teacher or a boy scout leader or anyone.' Great teacher: Marilyn Mecham was in her first year of teaching when she taught Perz in home economics . Perz owns a company called Dynamic Fastener, which sells tools and fasteners to commercial contractors throughout the country. The experience has left a lasting effect on Mecham, who was in her first year of teaching when she taught Perz. 'Gratitude is something in this society today that we just don't do enough of,' Mecham told ABC. 'It's made me stop and think who do I want to thank,' she said.

'It's a difficult moment for him. He was the best player on the pitch and in his dreams last night he was probably hoping he would get them through to the final. 'He did everything to do so but got very unlucky in extra-time. The Australian let an Alexis Sanchez effort slip through his hands and sneak over the line in extra-time . 'It was a really good performance from him and he's shown what a good keeper he is.' Arsenal looked like they might enjoy a comfortable afternoon when Sanchez opened the scoring in the first half, but Garath McCleary's equaliser galvanised the Championship outfit. 'You know what to expect when you play Championship sides,' Szczesny said. Federici was inconsolable at the final whistle despite his team-mates and staff trying to help . 'They're very solid defensively, they're not scared to put their foot or head in and they defend very well. 'Today they did that with a great performance by their goalkeeper. It was a difficult game but we just got over the line.' Arsenal are now just one win away from defending the crown they secured last year, with either Liverpool or Aston Villa lying in wait in the final. Szczesny was also at fault for the Reading goal when he let Gareth McCleary's shot find a way into the net . Victory would also see the Gunners become the most successful FA Cup team of all time as they currently sit level on 11 titles with Manchester United. 'We want to win for the fans,' Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla added. 'It's always special to play at Wembley and we have a good opportunity to get the title.

Late goals from Robert Huth and Jamie Vardy sealed a dramatic 3-2 victory against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, a week after Andy King's late goal secured a 2-1 win against West Ham United. The Foxes had look buried two weeks ago, seven points adrift of the relative safety of 17th place, but are now just three points behind Hull City, the side immediately above the relegation trapdoor.

Robert Huth nodded home with 10 minutes left on the clock to help his side launch an emphatic comeback . Foxes boss Nigel Pearson (left) believes Premier League survival is still firmly placed in his side's hands . Crucially Leicester, who have discovered an attacking potency with eight goals in three games, have a game in hand over their survival rivals and play five of their final seven fixtures at home. 'One thing we've spoken about recently is we want to keep (our fate) in our own hands for as long as possible,' Pearson told the BBC. 'While it's in our own hands you know that the responsibility is solely with ourselves. In many ways that's the driving force for us but we've still got an awful lot to do. 'It's more congested (at the bottom of the table) but because of the gap there has been for such a long time we don't have any chances of getting away with a disappointing result. Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso opened the scoring against West Ham with a spectacular effort last Saturday . However the Foxes were instantly punished when West Ham midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate netted immediately . But Andy King (left) was the hero as the Premier League strugglers struck late on at the King Power Stadium . 'We've got to try and force the issue between now and the end of the season.' Leicester have been rooted to the foot of the table since November but are slowly building much-needed momentum as the battle to avoid the drop intensifies. 'I hope (we've got momentum). Back-to-back wins are difficult to achieve, especially for a side like ourselves who have been struggling for vast parts of the season in terms of results,' he said. 'It's going to be tough but we'll give it a good shot.'

The sandstorm wrecked havoc across the area last week, causing traffic accidents, the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents. Images show the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates and reaching as far east as India and Pakistan over a period of seven days. Scroll down for video . On April 1, the sandstorm could be seen enveloping much of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . The following day, it pushed further east to cause flight cancellations in Dubai . By April 4, it was beginning to stretch across the Arabia Sea towards Pakistan and India . A final image taken on April 7 shows much of it had dispersed across the sea while some remained over Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman . It began on April 1, when high winds whipped up the sandstorm in northern Saudi Arabia before it consolidated and began moving southeastward across the peninsula to eventually cover an area almost as large as the United States, Discover Magazine reported. Along the way it caused chaos across the area's major cities including Riyadh and Dubai, where some locations were reduced to zero visibility, streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut. The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies said: 'The blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations, disrupting ground transportation, air traffic, and also closing schools. 'Visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at Dubai International Airport, which is one of the world\u2019s busiest in terms of volume of flights.' More than 450 Saudi Arabian Airlines flights were cancelled between Wednesday and Friday - which equals 33 per cent of the carrier's 1,526 scheduled flights, the Saudi Gazette reported. On top of this, 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam. According to the BBC, strong winds aggravated the problem, causing a 'near complete lack of vision in daylight', the UAE National Centre for Meteorology and Seismology said. Despite sandstorms being a relatively common occurrence in that part of the world, they are not generally so big and rarely wreak so much havoc. In this instance, the storm also blew across Saudi Arabia's Empty Quarter - the world's second largest desert which reaches into Yemen and Oman.

Researchers have, up until now, held off from excavating the remains as they believed it would cause irreparable to the skeleton. An earlier study of the head and part of a shoulder of suggested the skeleton belong to a Neanderthal. The current project has been ongoing for six years with researchers taking a tiny part of shoulder bone and analysing it in the lab. It is believed that Altamura Man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck. Altamura is a city of Apulia, in southern Italy.\u00a0It is believed that Altamura Man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck . Researchers have, up until now, held off from excavating the remains as they believed it would cause irreparable to the skeleton. An earlier study of the head and part of a shoulder of suggested the skeleton belong to a Neanderthal. Pictured is\u00a0\u2018Altamura Man's\u2019 skull from different angles . Scientists assume he starved to death, or died from lack of water - but not much else is known about his life. Analysis revealed that the calcite on skull was formed 172,000 to 130,000 years ago, during a period when ice sheets were expanding significantly from out of Antarctica and Greenland. The team say samples of DNA have also been retrieved from the sample, and because of the age, represent the oldest such samples ever recovered from Neanderthal remains. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. If they manage to sequence the DNA, they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the Neanderthal. Separate research earlier this week found that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today - and this may be what killed them off. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies .", "reference": "Altamura Man was discovered in a cave in 1993 in southern Italy .\nSkeleton's calcium formations suggest it is 128,000 to 187,000 years old .\nScientists have successful extracted DNA and are trying to sequence it .\nThey say DNA might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids .", "pred_summary": "Scientists in Italy have extracted the oldest ever DNA sample to be taken from a Neanderthal."}

Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight.

He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge. 'But firstly, I wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements. Sometimes you can underestimate what it's like going straight into a new job.

'The whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge. It is a sad situation.

The 10 stores trialling the scheme include Blackburn, Bolton, Preston, Bradford, West Bromwich, Birmingham, Leamington Spa and three in London.

Two-year-old Faizaan Ali (right) was among the first to sample the sweets in the chain's Blackburn store. The company, which has over 500 stores around the UK, has chosen the locations according to the make-up of their local communities. John Brooksbank, store general manager of Morrisons in Blackburn, said: 'Many customers have asked us about Halal sweets, so we have designed and introduced a new range. 'We are the first big supermarket in the UK to do this. It's a large range so we hope that it will provide a sweet treat for every taste. 'We would consider introducing the halal sweets range at other stores, should there be a demand. 'Yummys, the brand available, is a recognised Halal confectionery brand, which we are also selling in single bags in our world food aisle.' The supermarket has been praised by Muslim figures after announcing the move. Husnaa Ali, nine, tucks in to the treats at one of 10 stores around Britain chosen to trial the new scheme . The supermarket says it has brought in the idea in response to demand from customers in certain areas . Salim Mulla, chairman of the halal sub-committee at the Lancashire Council of Mosques, said: 'I think there are quite a few manufacturers who sell halal sweets but this is the first major supermarket to sell halal confectionery. I really welcome that. Halal  involves specific methods of killing animals which adhere to Islamic laws. Livestock or poultry must be slaughtered by cutting the jugular vein and carotid artery while the animal is alive and healthy. The blood is then drained from the carcass, while a Muslim recites a dedication. Views differ over whether the animal can be stunned before being killed. Halal sweets include only gelatin from halal slaughtered animals and do not contain any other animal-derived ingredients from non-halal animals. 'It is definitely something the Council of Mosques would support. Sweets are very popular with the Muslim community. I think the pick and mix will do really well.' Until now, Muslims have had to look at the ingredients to see if the sweets are suitable to eat as some contain animal products which are not halal. Abdul Hamid Qureshi, chairman of the Lancashire Council of Mosques, added: 'More and more supermarkets are introducing halal products to meet the needs of the customers, but this is the first halal pick and mix I have heard of. 'There will be financial reasons behind it. Businesses will not just sell products for social needs.

{"article": "President Barack Obama declared the threat of cyber attacks by foreign agents a 'national emergency' as he unveiled plans to impose sanctions on hackers in the wake of an epidemic of attacks against American networks. Obama took aim at Russia, China and Iran as he revealed an executive order which will allow\u00a0the U.S. Treasury  to freeze or block assets of those involved in attacks on 'critical' American computer networks. The announcement followed a series of high profile incidents, including a devastating attack against Sony Pictures, and data breaches that stole credit card or health data on tens of millions of Americans. 'National emergency': Obama unveiled plans to impose sanctions on hackers after an epidemic of attacks . 'It\u2019s one of the great paradoxes of our Information Age \u2014 the very technologies that empower us to do great good can also be used by adversaries to inflict great harm,' he wrote in a blog post on Medium. Obama said cyber attacks - many which originate from overseas - 'pose one of the most serious economic and national security challenges to the United States'. He added it required more than 'diplomacy, law enforcement, and cooperation with other nations and the private sector' to tackle. He wrote: 'It's often hard to go after bad actors, in part because of weak or poorly enforced foreign laws, or because some governments are either unwilling or unable to crack down on those responsible.' Obama said hackers working in China and Russia target America's defense contractors and the systems designed to support the country's troops, while hackers in Iran were targeting banks and North Korea went after Sony. Michael Daniel, special assistant to the president and cyber security co-ordinator, said the new sanctions would 'go after the worst of the worst of malicious cyber actors', while Obama assured people they would 'in no way target the unwitting victims of cyberattacks,' such as people whose computers are hijacked. However, they did not reveal any specific targets, but officials told the Financial Times\u00a0it could be used against individual hackers hired by companies or countries. Threat: The attacks included last year's Sony pictures hack - allegedly carried out by North Korea. Pictured: The secretive state's leader,\u00a0Kim Jong-un . Anger: It is said the country was unhappy about the film The Interview (poster, right), which depicted an assassination attempt against the North Korean leader, portrayed by Randall Park (left) They would also not curb the freedom of the internet, Obama stated. But some privacy activists questioned the broad language in the order, saying it could have unforeseen impacts. The order could be interpreted to target investigative reporters, said Marcy Wheeler on the privacy blog Empty Wheel. 'Does WikiLeaks' publication of secret Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations qualify? Does Guardian's publication of contractors' involvement in NSA hacking?' she wrote. 'I'm generally concerned about this (order) because of the way national emergencies have served as the justification for a lot of secret spying decisions,' Wheeler added. But Paul Rosenzweig of the Chertoff Group, a security consulting firm, said the national emergency language is appropriate. 'The use of \"national emergency'\" is reflective, I think, of the seriousness with which the administration views the problem \u2014 and that's a good thing,' Rosenzweig said on the Lawfare blog. 'What is most notable about the order is how strongly the US is flexing its economic muscle. If access to US markets is of value, the administration is signalling, strongly, that continued access may be conditioned on good cyber behavior. Concern: Some privacy activists questioned the broad language in the order and its unforeseen impacts . However, Obama's advisers were keen to stress how important the new measures were. Lisa Monaco, the President's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, wrote in a blog: 'In just the past year, we have seen a significant increase in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the American people, including everything from large data breaches and significant intrusions to destructive and coercive cyber attacks intended to influence the way ordinary Americans exercise their constitutional rights. 'In many cases, these threats stem from actors overseas using malicious cyber activities to inflict harm on Americans without ever leaving their desks.' Ms Monaco warned 'no one connected to the internet is immune' to the threat, buyt added the sanctions \u00a0are 'not a tool that we will use every day' and 'law-abiding companies have absolutely nothing to worry about'.", "reference": "Barack Obama made announcement following high profile cyber attacks .\nSays hackers targeting U.S. from places including Russia, China and Iran .\nCritical of 'governments unable or unwilling' to go after 'bad actors'\nNew order allows treasury to freeze or block assets of those involved .\nIt is hoped the power will take away the financial incentive behind attacks .", "pred_summary": "President Barack Obama declared the threat of cyber attacks by foreign agents a 'national emergency'"}

Professor Giuseppe Ferrari, head of the Italian occult watchdog The Group on Research and Socio-Religious Information, made the revelation when speaking to a Vatican-backed exorcism course in Rome. Hollywood films portraying 'beautiful young vampires', such as Robert Pattinson in Twilight, are said to be driving an increase in young people dabbling in the occult . True Blood, featuring Anna Paquin (left) and Joe Manganiello (right), is another TV show which depicts vampires living in modern society . He told those in attendance: 'There are those who try to turn people into vampires and make them drink other people's blood, or encourage them to have special sexual relations to obtain special powers,' The Independent reported. 'These groups are attracted by the so-called beautiful young vampires that we've seen so much of in recent years.' Such incidents are considered a form of demonic possession by the Vatican. Although it continues to celebrate the role exorcisms play within the Church, it maintains strong guidelines on how and when they should be carried out. In 2013, Pope Francis appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair-bound man who said he was possessed by the devil. The Vatican insisted the pope 'didn't intend to perform any exorcism,' and it released a statement that said 'he simply intended to pray for someone who was suffering who was presented to him'. The man later said that Francis had failed to banish the demons from his body. However, after Francis placed his hands on him, he was able to walk again, he claimed. The ancient rite of casting out Satan and his demons from the souls of the possessed has been carried out in the Catholic Church for centuries. In 2013, Pope Francis appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair-bound man who said he was possessed by the devil . But the practice of exorcism saw a revival of interest following the 1973 film The Exorcist and other popular film and literature references. Speaking to Vatican Radio, Dr Valter Cascioli, a psychiatrist and spokesman for the International Association of Exorcists, last year warned of 'an extraordinary increase in demonic activity'. He said that this makes it even more worrying that 'the number of people who are turning to these practices, which are damaging psychologically, spiritually and morally, is constantly growing'. The Association, which brings together Catholic priests and psychiatrists, was founded in 1990 and given formal recognition by the Vatican in June. Dr Cascioli said that too many people today undervalue the temptation to engage in 'ordinary demonic activity', which leaves them unprepared to fight off greater attacks by the devil. In societies marked by 'rushing, superficiality, exaggerated individualism and secularization,' he added, 'the battle against evil and the devil increasingly is becoming an emergency'.", "reference": "Films and movies are said to be driving a growing interest in occult forces .\nAn exorcism expert claims youngsters are inspired by 'beautiful vampires'\nSuch shows include the hugely successful True Blood series and Twilight .", "pred_summary": "Hollywood films such as Twilight and The Exorcist depict 'beautiful young vampires'\nVatican-backed exorcism course encourages new generation of demonic possession.\nProfessor makes revelation at Vatican-backed course in Rome."}
{"article": "Nearly one out of six NFL players will declare bankruptcy within 12 years of retiring from the league, a shocking new study has revealed. The rate of bankruptcy, 15.7percent - remained the same no matter how long the players were in the league or how well they were paid, according to researchers from the California Institute of Technology, George Washington University and the University of Washington. Despite earning millions of dollars - sometimes tens of millions - former players go broke at about 1.1percent per year, the same rate as the rest of Americans. Bleak future: Despite NFL players earning millions - sometimes times of millions - over the course of their careers, nearly 16percent of players are bankrupt within 12 years . Vince Young earned a reported $64million in salary and endorsement deals - but was bankrupt before he even finished his NFL career. Widely reported rumors say he spent $5,000 a week at Cheesecake factory . Though bleak, the 15.7percent figure found by the researchers, is dramatically lower than a widely quoted statistic that 78percent of retired players are bankrupt or under 'financial stress' within two years of leaving the league. The figure comes from a 2009 survey by Sports Illustrated. Often, when athletes go broke, it's because of unimaginable extravagances, bad investments and massive child support payments. \u00a0This, despite the fact that the average player makes $3.2million over the course of a career. Defensive tackle Warren Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL and made more than $82million. He retired in 2007 and filed for bankruptcy in 2012 - citing several failed business ventures. Bankruptcy remained at similar rates even among players who had long, profitable careers in the sport - though it was highest for those who stayed in the league for five years - and lower for those who were in it for more than a decade . Michael Vick, who made more than $130million, is still playing has he attempts to pay off his $18million bankruptcy debt from 2008 . When his estate was sold at auction, he had a lionskin rug and 240 pairs of sneakers. He also owed more than $75,000 a month in child support for his six children (with five different women,) Quarterback Vince Young's played his last NFL game in December 2011. He filed for bankruptcy in January 2014 - despite earning $34million in salary and another $30million in endorsement deals. Widely reported rumors that emerged after he first began having financial trouble in 2012 claim that he spent up to $5,000 a week at Cheesecake Factory and racked up a $6,000 tab at TGI Friday's. Young also blamed investment advisers who he claimed took advantage of him. Quarterback Michael Vick filed for bankruptcy in 2008 - in the middle of his high-profile career and legal troubles that sent him to prison. He was still paying off his $18million in debts in 2014 - despite making $130million from the NFL and millions more from endorsement deals. 'We've known that it can be very difficult for the average family to save,' Cal Tech finance professor Colin F. Camerer, one of the researchers, told the Washington Post. 'But this is one group that you might think ought to be able to avoid bankruptcy. They're in a position to buy some good advice if they need it.

{"article": "Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Rescuers in Nepal have pulled a man from the wreckage of a building where he was stuck for a staggering 82 hours after the devastating earthquake that hit the country Saturday. His survival is unusual, as experts say it's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster. The man, Rishi Khanal, was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu, the capital, around noon Tuesday, said Pushparam K.C., a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal. The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life, he said. But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out, the spokesman said. A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal's location and then hauling him up through the hole. They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher. On Wednesday afternoon, Khanal, 27, had just undergone surgery and was resting, surrounded by family and friends. He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience. \"It seems he survived by sheer willpower,\" said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated Khanal, according to the Reuters news agency. Khanal's story of survival isn't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake, which has killed more than 5,000 people. A 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck, the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported. A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard, the newspaper said. The little boy, whose name is Sonit Awal, was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries, according to initial examinations. CNN hasn't independently confirmed Sonit's rescue, but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure. Tanka Maya Sitoula, a 40-year-old mother of four, was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city, bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment. She endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an Indian rescue team freed her. She escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble. \"I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued,\" she said, as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school. What did she do for 36 hours? \"I was just lying down,\" she said. \"There was no room to move here and there.\" Sitoula's husband, Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in Kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake. Rescue workers flown in from Turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him. Encased in an orange stretcher, he was lifted to safety Tuesday. But he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down, shaking his head from side to side. One of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water. Keisi was injured and dehydrated, but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Kathmandu, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

{"article": "Comedian Sarah Silverman is encouraging women to understand their worth and ask for equal pay in a new campaign in which she recounts a time she was discriminated against because of her gender. The 44-year-old, who is known for her wicked sense of humor, gets serious for Levo League's Ask4More\u00a0campaign, which calls for women to request the salaries that they deserve in honor of Equal Pay Day on April 14. 'I think the best person for the job should get jobs,' she says in the campaign video.\u00a0'I'm all for women having to work harder to prove themselves at this juncture if that's the way it is in the world. But if you work a job, and a man is working the same job, you should be getting paid the same.' Scroll down for video . Be confident: Sarah Silverman wants women to understand their worth as a part of Levo League's new\u00a0Ask4More campaign, which encourages women to request the salaries that they deserve . On average, women only earn 78 cents for every dollar made by men, and in the clip, the actress recalls a time when she was faced with an even worse pay margin because of her gender. Sarah explains that she and fellow comedian Todd Barry were doing back-to-back stand up sets on a Saturday night at the New York Comedy Club. Even though she says she was 'pretty well known at the time', she 'didn't think anything of it' when she was given $10 for her work. But when she was chatting with Todd outside, it soon came up that he was offered $60 for the same amount of work - at the same show. When she went back inside and asked Al Martin, the owner at the time, about the pay discrepancy, he thought that she was asking him to lend her money, saying: 'Oh, did you want a $60 spot?' Not right: In the video, Sarah recalls a time when she was paid $10 to do a stand-up routine, when a man who performed the same amount of time earned $60 . 'It was symbolic. I didn't need $60,' she says of that moment. 'You know, it\u2019s pretty sh****.' Sarah, who came under fire last month after she tweeted 'ten rape prevention tips' aimed at male attackers, says whenever she shares anything 'women's rights related' on social media, including equal pay and health care, she gets 'the most violent hate tweets back'. 'It's so odd. It's just bizarre,' she says. Sarah explains that knowing your self-worth is a big factor when it comes to women feeling confident to ask for more. 'My therapist says - and I think about it all the time - we don't get what we want. We get what we think we deserve,' she added. Double standard: The 44-year-old comedian, who is pictured at the\u00a02015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, says she gets 'the most violent hate tweets' when she discusses women's issues on Twitter . Sports fan: Sarah, who often plays basketball with men, was pictured with Anthony Anderson as they watched Sprite NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in New York City in February . She notes that the concept of asking for more and understanding your worth reminds of her of how she feels when she plays basketball with men. 'Every basket you miss is like missing 100 baskets and that comes from inside.' Sarah says she reminds herself that she isn't letting her team down, nor or the guys angry at her for missing a shot. The pressure she feels is being brought upon by herself. She explains that she finally realized that 'the guys shoot and miss all the time - most of the time - and they get better. 'We deserve quality lives with equality, and maybe control over our own human bodies without the government getting involved, to do whatever we get great at and do, and it has to come from inside and understanding that you deserve it and working to deserve it,' she says, before adding: \u2018Go ahead. Ask for more.' Sarah is a part of the nine-day campaign, which aims to empower women throughout their careers and includes other female celebrity supporters such as Amy Poehler, Chelsea Clinton and Constance Zimmer.", "reference": "The 44-year-old came under fire last month after she tweeted 'ten rape prevention tips' aimed at male attackers .\nIn the Levo League's Ask4More campaign video, Sarah recalls a time she was discriminated against because of her gender .", "pred_summary": "Sarah Silverman campaigns for women to understand their worth in honor of Equal Pay Day.\nOn average, women earn 78 cents for every dollar made by men.\nThe comedian says she gets 'the most violent hate tweets' when she discusses women's issues on Twitter."}

In an attempt to explain his state of mind at the time of the attack, he said: \u2018Two days before the \u201cfracas\u201d, I had been told, sternly, by my doctor that the lump on my tongue was probably cancer and that I must get it checked out immediately. But I couldn\u2019t do that. 'We were in the middle of a Top Gear series. And Top Gear always came first.\u2019 Clarkson said he had now been given the all-clear, but wrote in his column in\u00a0The Sunday Times: \u2018That was the most stressful day I have ever had in 27 years at the BBC. \u2018It was beyond-belief stressful, everything was gong wrong, and then you know... there you go. But everyone has stressful days, and they manage to cope better than I had.\u2019 Clarkson was sacked by the Corporation after an \u2018unprovoked physical and verbal\u2019 attack in Hawes, North Yorkshire that left his victim, Oisin Tymon, 36, in need of hospital treatment. The presenter said the show about cars had come to dominate his life after his divorce from wife Frances and the death of his mother Shirley, and he worried about all parts of the programme. Scroll down for video . Top Gear: Clarkson (pictured centre with co-presenters Richard Hammond, left, and James May, right) said the show about cars had come to dominate his life after his divorce and the death of his mother . Shock: Clarkson (pictured with in London last Tuesday) has said that two days before assaulting a BBC producer he was told he might have cancer . He said: \u2018I woke every morning worrying about every single line.\u00a0And I went to bed at night worrying that the changes I\u2019d made during the day were wrong. \u2018Friends would talk to me when we were out and, though I could see their lips moving, I couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying.\u2019 He added: \u2018I felt sick because after I\u2019d lost my home and my mother, I\u2019d thrown myself even more vigorously into my job and now, idiotically, I\u2019d managed to lose that too.\u2019 Clarkson also revealed that he expected to present another television show about cars in the future. The star was suspended by the broadcaster last month when he became the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Mr Tymon, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him. Divorced: Clarkson, 55, and his wife Frances, 53, pictured together in London in April 2008 while stile married . Clarkson's contract was not renewed, with director-general Tony Hall saying at the time 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. But the broadcasting veteran received widespread public support, including from friend Prime Minister David Cameron. Clarkson said he even considered turning his back on presenting altogether in the immediate fall-out from the incident. Earlier this month, North Yorkshire Police said that following an investigation Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel. Clarkson pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You, which was due to be filmed next week, and aired a day later. It would have been his first BBC appearance since the fracas which led to his exit.", "reference": "Clarkson, 55, had cancer scare two days before assaulting Oisin Tymon .\nHe had a lump on his tongue which doctors said was probably cancer .\nClarkson has been given all clear but says it was most stressful day ever .\nFormer Top Gear presenter was sacked by BBC after 'unprovoked attack'", "pred_summary": "Sacked by the BBC on April 10, said receiving a cancer warning was one of the most stressful experiences of his life.\nPresenter said he expected to present another television show about cars in the future."}

{"article": "No-fly list: Chris Roberts, a computer security researcher on his way to give a talk about computer security vulnerabilities at a major conference was told he couldn't fly on United Airlines Saturday, due to comments he'd made on Twitter . United Airlines stopped a prominent security researcher from boarding a California-bound flight late Saturday, following a social media post by the researcher days earlier suggesting the airline's onboard systems could be hacked. The researcher, Chris Roberts, attempted to board a United flight from Colorado to San Francisco to speak at a major security conference there this week, but was stopped by the airline's corporate security at the gate. Roberts founded One World Labs, which tries to discover security risks before they are exploited. Roberts had been removed from a United flight on Wednesday by the FBI after landing in Syracuse, New York, and was questioned for four hours after jokingly suggesting on Twitter he could get the oxygen masks on the plane to deploy. Authorities also seized Roberts' laptop and other electronics, although his lawyer says he hasn't seen a search warrant. A lawyer for Roberts said United gave him no detailed explanation on Saturday why he wasn't allowed on the plane, saying instead the airline would be sending Roberts a letter within two weeks stating why they wouldn't let him fly on their aircraft. 'Given Mr. Roberts' claims regarding manipulating aircraft systems, we've decided it's in the best interest of our customers and crew members that he not be allowed to fly United,' airline spokesman Rahsaan Johnson told The Associated Press. 'However, we are confident our flight control systems could not be accessed through techniques he described.' When asked what threat Roberts posed if United's systems couldn't be compromised, Johnson said Sunday: 'We made this decision because Mr. Roberts has made comments about having tampered with aircraft equipment, which is a violation of United policy and something customers and crews shouldn't have to deal with.' Grounded: United made the decision not to allow Roberts to fly on United 'because he had made public statements about having manipulated airfare equipment and aircraft systems'. In this Tweet, Roberts speculates on whether he should give the command to drop a 737's oxygen masks . Hacking:\u00a0Once onboard, he pondered on Twitter whether he would be able to hack into the flight's onboard computer settings. In a previous Tweet (seen here) he posted pictures containing details of aircraft data . Concern: Roberts was questioned by FBI agents  for four hours.\u00a0All of his computer equipment, including an iPad, a MacBook Pro, several hard drives and several USB memory sticks were confiscated . Johnson said the airline reached Roberts several hours before his flight to tell him he couldn't fly. But a lawyer for Roberts said Sunday that when his client received that call, the caller would only say he or she was from United, and wouldn't give Roberts a name or callback number. When Roberts then tried calling the number back from his phone's caller ID, it rang instead to a resort hotel, and Roberts assumed it was a prank call, Roberts' lawyer said. In recent weeks, Roberts gave media interviews in which he discussed airline system vulnerabilities. 'Quite simply put, we can theorize on how to turn the engines off at 35,000 feet and not have any of those damn flashing lights go off in the cockpit,' he told Fox News. Roberts also told CNN he was able to connect to a box under his seat at least a dozen times to view data from the aircraft's engines, fuel and flight-management systems. 'It is disappointing that United refused to allow him to board, and we hope that United learns that computer security researchers are a vital ally, not a threat,' said Nate Cardozo, a staff attorney with the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, which represents Roberts. Expert?\u00a0Roberts' talk that he was about to give was in part about the vulnerabilities of transportation systems . Blocked: United isn't happy about Chris Roberts being on its planes will no longer allow him to fly on its aircraft . Cardozo said Sunday he hasn't seen a copy of a search warrant that would have been used to seize Roberts' electronics, and that he's working to get the devices returned. The FBI declined to comment on the matter Sunday. The Government Accountability Office said last week that some commercial aircraft may be vulnerable to hacking over their onboard wireless networks. 'Modern aircraft are increasingly connected to the Internet. This interconnectedness can potentially provide unauthorized remote access to aircraft avionics systems,' its report found. Roberts took an alternate flight on Southwest Airlines and arrived in San Francisco Saturday evening. He speaks this week at the RSA Conference about computer security vulnerabilities.", "reference": "Chris Roberts says he sent his tweet because he's frustrated that a security flaw isn't being addressed .\nThe FBI pulled him from a United Airlines  Boeing 737 .\nRoberts said FBI agents detained and questioned him for four hours .\nClams anyone can plug a laptop into the box underneath their seat and reach key controls in the plane, such as engines and cabin lighting .", "pred_summary": "Security researcher Chris Roberts was stopped at the gate by United on Saturday.\nHe was on his way to give a talk at a major security conference in San Francisco.\nThe airline said he couldn't fly after making public statements about manipulating aircraft systems.\nLawyer: 'We hope United learns that computer security researchers are a vital ally, not a threat'"}

In many instances, the breads were partially baked in factories overseas, frozen, and shipped to Australia months later to be sold as freshly baked loaves to consumers.

The man dubbed 'Britain's most feckless father' after having 15 children by the age of 30 is back on the market after he split from his most recent pregnant girlfriend. Jobless Keith MacDonald, 29, from Sunderland in Tyne and Wear, has sired a massive brood with at least ten mothers - and is estimated to cost the taxpayer over \u00a32million. He was set to become a father for the sixteenth time but has revealed he's split from the unborn child's mother. MacDonald, of County Durham, says he's back on the dating market - and the baby in question is not actually his. He said: 'There is no baby - it's not mine and I'm single now.' MacDonald, who has appeared on Jeremy Kyle, says he gets most of his women by chatting them up on the bus. In the past, he bragged: 'It's easy - they never seem to say no. Just chat them up on the bus. I just pick them up like that. 'That's what I do and they never seem to say no. If they like you, they like you. Get their number and text them and arrange to meet when you come off the bus.' Last month he caused a stir when he appeared on Channel 5 documentary\u00a040 Kids by 20 Women. MacDonald told the programme he can't find work, partly because he is 'no good at listening', and spends most of him time playing computer games. Scroll down for video . He says he finds it hard to meet new women because of his reputation in Sunderland and is shown in the programme going to Birmingham to 'pull girls'. MacDonald hit the headlines in 2011 when he tried to fake his own death in a bid to shirk responsibility for his ninth child.

Charlotte Anderson (left) with her daughter Kady-Marie Anderson and June Garrick with her son Brendan Garrick (right), all in 2005. Both children are believed to have been fathered by MacDonald . In November 2012, he was found guilty by Sunderland magistrates of common assault and stealing from one of his ex-partners after a row over a cheese toastie. The binman's son was desperate to avoid paying out any more than the \u00a35 a week he was putting towards each of his other children. Keith MacDonald: . - Unemployed . - Reportedly receives incapacity benefit for bad back of up \u00a368.95 a week and \u00a344 income support . - Said to contribute just \u00a35 of his weekly income to his children . - The total benefit bill racked up by him and his offspring has been estimated at \u00a32million from birth to 18 . He pretended to be one of his friends and sent a text message to his pregnant former girlfriend Clare Bryant, 22, telling her: 'Keith is dead.' Miss Bryant, who already had a one-year-old daughter by MacDonald, rang his mobile phone, but there was no answer. She then called the local hospitals and the police, but to no avail. Two weeks passed before Miss Bryant found out that 25-year-old MacDonald was, in fact, alive and well. He sent her a message to apologise and told her that he wanted to 'get away from his life'. He refuses to use contraception and had fathered six children by the time he turned 20 - including two he claims were conceived on double-decker buses. In 2008 he bragged: 'It's not my fault - I thought they were all on the pill. Lasses keep on coming up to me.' Macdonald first became a father at 15 as he left school and has rarely worked since saying he finds it boring. He has previously claimed incapacity allowance for a 'bad back'. MacDonald was just one of several feckless fathers to gain infamy after appearing in 40 Kids by 20 Women. Michael Holpin, a 56-year-old unemployed alcoholic from Ebbw Vale, South Wales, became an unlikely TV star after appearing in the documentary. He claims to have 40 children by 20 women - and says while he would not recognise many of his offspring in the street, he wants more.

{"article": "Dame Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England,\u00a0is facing the threat of a new inquiry into claims she put patient safety at risk in a drive to meet targets . The most powerful woman in the NHS is facing the threat of a new inquiry into claims that she put patient safety at risk in a drive to meet targets, the Mail can reveal. Dame Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, was accused of gagging a whistleblower who tried to warn about the impact of targets on ordinary patients. She was investigated by the General Medical Council, which concluded that there was no case to answer. However, it is now reviewing part of this decision and is appointing an independent expert to consider if the original investigation went \u2018far enough\u2019 in respect of patient safety. The GMC is concerned that there \u2018may have been a material flaw\u2019 in the previous decision, which could lead to the case being reopened. Dame Barbara, 57, a former Bradford GP who worked alongside Sir David Nicholson when he was NHS chief, was criticised for the gagging of whistleblower Gary Walker while she was in charge of East Midlands Strategic Health Authority. Mr Walker and other senior executives at the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULHT) claim that they had raised concerns with her that the enforcement of targets \u2013 implemented by the last Labour government \u2013 was endangering lives. This, they alleged, contributed to the trust being in the bottom 25 of the Department of Health\u2019s mortality league tables and being compared to the scandal-hit Mid Staffs. They took their allegations to the GMC, the regulatory body for doctors, who investigated but concluded that there was no case to answer. But following complaints to the watchdog about its review, it is calling for an independent report. The GMC said the absence of such a report \u2018may amount to a material flaw in the investigation\u2019 that may have affected the decision. \u2018There are concerns that the evidence gathered in the initial investigation did not go far enough in relation to allegations surrounding patient safety,\u2019 it said. The GMC concluded that the review is \u2018necessary for the protection of the public\u2019. Dame Barbara, 57, a former GP, was criticised for the gagging of whistleblower Gary Walker (above), who tried to warn about the impact of targets, while she was in charge of East Midlands Strategic Health Authority . It added: \u2018The specific question here is whether Dr Hakin\u2019s fitness to practise could be called into question on the basis of her insistence that ULHT met the NHS targets no matter what. Further evidence from an external independent expert would have been useful to consider whether Dr Hakin\u2019s actions were reasonable in all of the circumstances.\u2019 Dame Barbara, who earns around \u00a3205,000 in her current role and was referred to as the most powerful woman in the NHS by the Health Service Journal, said the original allegations were \u2018spurious and vexatious\u2019. She alleged they stemmed from the \u2018failure\u2019 of the ULHT board to manage the hospital and it was a \u2018campaign to discredit her\u2019. Mr Walker said yesterday: \u2018I am delighted the GMC is now considering that when Dr Hakin put pressure on me and my colleagues to hit targets it may have put the lives of patients at risk. \u2018The NHS tried to gag me and prevent me from giving evidence to the GMC but what really happened is finally being exposed. \u2018I hope now the GMC will do the right thing and seek to remove Dr Hakin\u2019s licence.\u2019 A GMC spokesman said it was \u2018reviewing a decision made as part of our original investigation\u2019 but added that Dame Barbara was not under investigation. Labour insisted that it was \u2018always clear that NHS targets should not be implemented in a way that jeopardises the quality of patient care\u2019.", "reference": "Dame Barbara Hakin, 57, facing threat of a new inquiry over patient safety .\nCalls for inquiry into claims she risked lives in a drive to meet set targets .\nAccused of gagging whistleblower Gary Walker who tried to warn of risks .\nGeneral Medical Council said no case to answer but reviewing its decision .", "pred_summary": "Dame Barbara Hakin\u00a0is facing the threat of a new inquiry into claims she put patient safety at risk."}
{"article": "Sanaa, Yemen  (CNN)Saudi airstrikes over Yemen have resumed once again, two days after Saudi Arabia announced the end of its air campaign. The airstrikes Thursday targeted rebel Houthi militant positions in three parts of Sanaa, two Yemeni Defense Ministry officials said. The attacks lasted four hours. The strikes caused no casualties, but did destroy all three military compounds that were targeted, the officials said. They said Saudi airstrikes were also targeting Houthi positions in Lahj province. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced the end of its Operation Decisive Storm, a nearly month-long air campaign against Houthi positions. The Saudi-led coalition said a new initiative was underway, Operation Renewal of Hope, focused on the political process. But less than 24 hours later, after rebel forces attacked a Yemeni military brigade, the airstrikes resumed, security sources in Taiz said. Five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late Wednesday, two Taiz security officials said. They said explosions lasted for about 40 minutes. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners started pounding Houthi positions across Yemen starting on March 26, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that overthrew the Yemeni government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government -- a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda -- which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives \"by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,\" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to \"nearly all demands\" of the U.N. Security Council. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. Houthi leader: 'Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming' On Wednesday, Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi in Sanaa, a senior Saudi source said on the condition of anonymity. The Houthis had said they detained the defense minister at an air base near the Yemeni port city of Aden on March 26, shortly before the Saudis began their airstrike campaign. The rebels had captured the base that day as part of an advance on the Aden area. The United Nations demanded al-Subaihi's release earlier this month. But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, who says he's Yemen's legitimate leader, thanked the Saudi-led coalition. He is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. \"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,\" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at \"the right time\" to rebuild the country. \"You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy.\" Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen?

The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped\u00a0genitalia found on other species in the area. Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. Mr Devreese said: 'Our photos are the world's first and confirm that the species is not extinct. 'No one knows anything about them. They live in an area where scientists rarely go, along the banks of a river a in a very inaccessible area.' Mr Devreese spent three months, after setting off in February, searching the jungles of Congo in an attempt to find the Bouvier red colobus monkeys, or Piliocolobus bouvieri. Together with his Congelese colleagues, he visited remote villages to ask locals if they had seen them and traced the locations of unconfirmed reports of sightings. A group of the monkeys were discovered living in the forests that sit along the Bokiba River in the Ntokou-Pikounda National Park. However, they found that the creatures appear to be extremely vulnerable to hunters involved in the commercial bushmeat trade in the area. Red colobus monkeys are among the largest primates in the forests of Congo and are prized by hunters. The animals are also poor at recognising threats, often believing they are safe in the trees. Rather than fleeing, red colobus monkeys tend to look down at humans from the trees. The last unconfirmed sighting of a Bouvier's red colobus monkey was in the 1970s and they are mentioned in a book from 1949 as living in swamp forests aong the Likouala and Sangha rivers. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. A video is shown above . The Bouvier's red colobus monkey lives in stretches of jungle alongside rivers in the Congo (pictured above) The only previous examples of them had been collected more than 100 years ago. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. Dr Fiona Maisels, from the Wildlife Conservation Society, said: 'We\u2019re very pleased indeed that Lieven and Ga\u00ebl were able to achieve their objective of not only confirming that Bouvier\u2019s red colobus still exists, but also managing to get a very clear close-up picture of a mother and infant. 'Thankfully, many of these colobus monkeys live in the recently gazetted national park and are protected from threats such as logging, agriculture, and roads, all of which can lead to increased hunting.' James Deutsch, vice president for conservation strategy at the WCS, added: 'Confirmation that Bouvier\u2019s red colobus still thrives in the this area reminds us that there remain substantially intact wild places on Earth, and should re-energize all of us to save them before it is too late.'", "reference": "Bouvier's red colobus monkeys was last sighted in the Congo during 1970s .\nBiologists have captured the first ever photographs of the rare primates .\nThe monkeys live in noisy groups in the swampy forests alongside rivers .\nThey are feared to be threatened by growing bushmeat trade in the area .", "pred_summary": "The Bouvier's red colobus monkey was thought to have died out more than 50 years ago.\nBut new species has been discovered in Tibet after researchers set up camera traps.\nIt has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped ones found on other species."}
{"article": "Officers who rushed to the scene of the Colorado theater shooting entered a hellish world of bloody victims, noxious smells and blaring sounds - a gloomy darkness pierced by bright flashes from a fire alarm, police testified Wednesday. 'It was dim, the movie was still playing, the alarm was going off,' Aurora police officer Annette Brook told jurors in the trial of gunman James Holmes. 'I began to notice the bodies, the live victims, the blood.' Prosecutors called Brook and two other officers as witnesses on Wednesday, and their descriptions of the chaos of inside the suburban Denver theater intensified the already disturbing scene described a day earlier by moviegoers who were badly wounded or saw loved ones gunned down in the July 20, 2012, attack. Scroll down for video . The third day of the trial against suspected Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes continued on Wednesday. If convicted, Holmes could be sentenced to death. Pictured above in court on Monday, far left . Twelve people were killed and 70 hurt when Holmes allegedly opened fire on a packed theater in Aurora, Colorado for a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises in July 2012. Above, the scene of the theater after the shooting . Twelve people died and 70 were wounded. Holmes is charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. He admits he was the shooter, his defense attorneys say, but schizophrenia had taken control of his mind and compelled him to kill. His lawyers are asking the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity, which would send him to the state mental hospital indefinitely. Prosecutors argue Holmes was sane and fully aware that what he was doing was wrong. They want the jury to convict him and sentence him to die. Holmes' defense attorneys want the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors say Holmes knew what he was doing, however. On the left, a sketch of Holmes in court on Monday and and 2012 mugshot on the right . In the opening days of the trial, prosecutors have appeared intent on planting a deeply upsetting image in the jurors' minds. 'It smelled very, very bad,' officer Tomas Campagna testified Wednesday, describing the mixed odors of blood, sweat, urine and feces. 'It's hard to imagine unless you've been there.' Spent cartridges and casings from a shotgun, a rifle and a handgun littered the ground, so thick that officers couldn't avoid stepping on them, Campagna said. In places, the floor looked like it had been painted in blood, he said. Cellphones left behind by the victims rang far into the night. More victims testified Wednesday, describing the booms and the brilliant flashes of light that burst from the muzzles of the weapons aimed at them and the hot pain of being shot. One of those victims was Joshua Nowlan, a former member of the military who worked on aircraft carriers. He went to the movie, 'The Dark Knight Rises,' at the Century 16 multiplex in the Denver suburb of Aurora with friends who had just returned from their honeymoon in Florida. About 15 or 20 minutes into the film, a tear gas canister was thrown into the theater, and then the shooting started. Nowlan, who shielded his friends from the bullets, was shot twice and has undergone multiple surgeries. He used the cane he now needs to walk to show jurors what he saw next. 'I assumed it had to be the shooter, from his stance ... He was walking around, and I can see him pointing the gun in a circular motion that looked like he was searching for more people ... I was terribly scared,' Nowlan told the court. 'My thought process was that he was searching for other people and that he was going to start going row by row, and that anybody he would see in that row who was still moving, he would shoot.' He described the shooter firing three-round bursts. Asked if the gunman moved fast or methodically, Nowlan said: 'He was definitely moving slowly.' None of the victims said they saw Holmes' face, but one of the police officers did. Sgt. Spc. Gerald Jonsgaard testified he saw Holmes lying on the ground in the parking lot outside the theater as two officers arrested him. Jonsgaard didn't identify Holmes by name Wednesday but said he was sitting at the defense table. Holmes' lawyers have not cross-examined any prosecution witnesses. They will call their own witnesses after the prosecution rests.", "reference": "Victims of the 2012 Colorado movie theater shooting testified in court on Wednesday as the trial of suspect James Holmes continued .\nPolice officers who responded to the scene also spoke in court about the incident which resulted in the deaths of 12 moviegoers .\nIf convicted, Holmes could face the death penalty .\nHis defense attorneys argue that he was insane .", "pred_summary": "Officers who rushed to the scene said they saw bloody victims and blaring sounds.\n'It was dim, the movie was still playing, the alarm was going off,' police officer said.\nJames Holmes is charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.\nIf convicted, he could be sentenced to death."}
{"article": "While being white, blonde and an attractive Anglo-Saxon shouldn't ensue judgement, according to Ellie Laing, SBS news reporter, it does come with a barrage of unfair perceptions. In an article by\u00a0The Australian\u00a0written on Monday, Jim Carroll, the News and Current Affairs Director of SBS, was reported to be taking a more 'commercial' approach to the network by hiring 'good-looking, female, Anglo-Celtic' journalists. While Carroll denies  he is hiring based on these standards, many of the journalists hired since his appointment in 2013 have fit the above bill. 'Never mind the fact that I work damned hard': SBS reporter Ellie Laing has launched a scathing attack on an article in The Australian that suggested she and other journalists were hired for being young, white and female . Ellie Laing,  SBS news reporter who was hired by Carroll, has now hit back at claims she was hired for her beauty over her brains in an open letter to critics. 'When a compliment suggesting I might be, in some way \u201cattractive,\" I\u2019ll take it, with delight,' she wrote in an open letter circulated to several news outlets. 'What I won\u2019t take is a suggestion that because I'm \u201cattractive\u201d, white and a woman it somehow detracts from the credibility and substance of the news service I work for.' Laing also wrote that despite a near decade of experience, hard work, established contacts and a regular six day week gig working as a journalism teacher at Macleay College on the side, none of this was taken into account. Diversity: The SBS was criticised for hiring young attractive reporters, with Sarah Abo one of the journalists mentioned in the article . 'In my case it didn't mention the near decade of experience I could bring to the newsroom after enjoying a long career across radio and TV at the ABC, Seven and Ten. Never mind the fact that I work damned hard.' The article also commented on the SBS content taking a more 'fluffy' lifestyle approach , which Laing shot back at by insisting  a need for an inclusion of the arts and a more balanced approach to hard news. Beyond the\u00a0affront\u00a0on her looks, credibility and the content, Laing made sure to\u00a0clear up one\u00a0thing \u00a0- she was hired for passion, not because she 'scrubs up\u00a0alright.' Alyshia Gates is another of the SBS journalists whose position were questioned by The Australian . Finishing\u00a0her letter with a fiery response for The Australian journalist behind the controversial article, Laing said: 'If he\u2019d watched the bulletin a bit closer he would have seen I\u2019ve changed my name to Ellie Laing (too).\u00a0I got married late last year. And yes, on my wedding day, I looked the most \u201cattractive\u201d I've ever been.' While Laing stands by Carroll and claims that suggest the over\u00a0importance\u00a0her looks play, this article comes at\u00a0the same week Karen\u00a0Middleton,  SBS political\u00a0correspondent announced her departure from the network. It's believed by insiders she didn't have the right 'profile' to fit Carroll's new criterion.

{"article": "A Lithuanian gangster accused of two murders in his home country has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds in a deportation farce after claiming he was too depressed to leave Britain. Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his \u2018manifestly ill-founded\u2019 case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the \u00a340,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: \u2018This is a shocking example of Labour\u2019s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.\u2019 Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius\u2019s claim that extradition breached his human rights was \u2018inadmissible\u2019. They added: \u2018The court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.\u2019", "reference": "Gangster Kestutis Martuzevicius accused of two murders in home country .\nHas repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him claiming he is too\u00a0depressed .\nNumerous appeals have cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds .\nThe case reignited row over foreign criminals exploiting human rights law .", "pred_summary": "Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights.\nThe 52-year-old is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, including two murders."}

Four years have passed since Dmitry Rybolovlev's takeover prompted a slew of big-name arrivals at the Stade Louis II, with the likes of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho signed for hefty transfer fees. But the Russian billionaire has tightened the purse strings in recent seasons and, with most of Monaco's expensive signings subsequently moving on, Jardim has been forced to nurture young talent after finding his options in the transfer market somewhat restricted.

{"article": "In a week where people have been highlighting the lack of young English talent in the Premier League, it\u2019s good to see three youngsters playing in my old position have really caught the eye this season. Calum Chambers, Eric Dier and John Stones have all enjoyed excellent Premier League campaigns. Defence is not the easiest area for a young player to make an impression \u2014 managers can be reluctant to trust youth in a position of responsibility \u2014 but these three have done just that. What sets them apart is their self-belief. Chambers and Stones are still 20 and Dier is 21, but there are no signs of fear in their games. Arsenal defender Calum Chambers (left) has impressed in his first season at the club . Everton defender John Stones (right) puts in a challenge against Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge . Tottenham defender Eric Dier (left) has grown in stature as the season has progressed at White Hart Lane . In a way, we shouldn\u2019t really be surprised. Between them they have cost \u00a319million, so they are not exactly surprise packages. What has been surprising is the way they have come on this season. They are by no means the finished article, but their progress is encouraging. It helps that all three have had a taste of playing at full back. I think they are all destined to become top central defenders, but if you are mobile enough, you are often asked to do a job at full back. At this stage it certainly does no harm to your development. I remember playing at right back before moving to the middle. You need pace and stamina to bomb up and down but when it comes to playing at centre half, that agility can be of huge benefit. I first saw Dier playing for the England Under 20s and he still looked raw. He was a powerful, quick right back who charged up and down, but he needed more control. I felt his body type made him ideally suited to centre half and he has made that position his own at Tottenham. Dier (left) stood up strongly against Chelsea striker Diego Costa in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley . Stones has moved across from right back into the centre of defence for Everton and has flourished . His rise has been quite spectacular. He has gone from a promising squad player to a first-team regular alongside Jan Vertonghen. He moves the ball well, is technically very good and he is a fighter \u2014 he stood up well to Diego Costa in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley. The next step for him is to become a vocal leader. The best central defenders demand so much from those around them and if that mentality is drilled into him, Dier could improve Tottenham\u2019s rather soft underbelly. Stones has spent time at right back but now finds himself at the heart of the Everton defence. He is very comfortable on the ball, has good speed and reads the game well so is rarely beaten one on one. He can tackle with either foot and his timing is excellent \u2014 just when you think he is beaten, he nicks the ball. He is comfortable playing out of defence but he has to be careful not to overplay. He is good in the air but can improve, especially from wide crosses and set-pieces. Experience will help him become more wily. With Chambers, I never doubted he was going to the right club, but I did wonder how many games he would play at Arsenal. With lots of competition for places, he has a real fight on his hands but he has already made 35 appearances this season. Of the three he is the best on the ball and if he makes a mistake, there is no drop in confidence \u2014 he still wants to make forward passes. That passing ability means there could be value in trying him in midfield, though that would require careful planning to bed him in. Chambers (right) has played at right back, centre-back and midfield for Arsenal during the season . England manager Roy Hodgson could be tempted to field the trio in a back three for the Three Lions . In one on ones, sometimes he doesn\u2019t look set. He likes to put an arm on the attacker to slow them down and that\u2019s partly why he has picked up eight bookings this season and been sent off. He tries to win the ball in the first few strides and can be prone to gambling. All three have taken huge steps forward this season, and with England using two centre-back partnerships in the last two games, those positions could be up for grabs. And if Roy Hodgson wants to fit more attacking players into his England side in the future, there\u2019s no reason why this trio, with their experiences at full back, couldn\u2019t play together in a back three. It would certainly be a useful option.", "reference": "Calum Chambers has played 35 times already for Arsenal this season .\nEric Dier has become an important first-team player at Tottenham .\nJohn Stones has impressed for Everton after being moved to the middle .", "pred_summary": "Arsenal's Calum Chambers, Eric Dier and John Stones have all enjoyed excellent Premier League campaigns.\nThe trio have all played at full back for their clubs this season, with Chambers making 35 appearances.\nJohn Stones has moved from right back to centre of defence for Everton and has flourished.\nEngland manager Roy Hodgson could be tempted to field the trio in a back three for the Three Lions."}

{"article": "Carefree: Linda MacDonald, 55, was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol Monday night in Dummerston, Vermont . This mugshot certainly won't be winning any points with the judge. Linda MacDonald, 55, was arrested on Monday for drunk driving and decided to stick out her tongue when she was brought to Vermont State Police barracks for booking. Police say the woman from Shelburne, Massachusetts was driving drunk around 10:30pm when she ran off Route 5 in Dummerston, Vermont and crashed her 2011 Toyota Camry into a wooden fence. At the scene, MacDonald told responding officers that she crashed while talking on the phone and trying to take directions down on a legal note pad in her car. But when officers smelled alcohol on MacDonald, they administered a breathalyzer test and she posted a .10 blood-alcohol content - above the state's legal threshold of .08. MacDonald stuck out her tongue for the cheeky picture after she was arrested and brought back to police headquarters on charges of driving while intoxicated. Police say that though MacDonald's car was heavily damaged, neither she or anyone else was injured in the one-vehicle crash. MacDonald was released on a citation and is scheduled back in court on April 28 for an arraignment. Public records do not indicate MacDonald has been arrested for DWI in the past. Sentencing for a first offense in Vermont range from a license suspension of 90 days to up to two years in prison and a maximum fine of $750.", "reference": "Linda MacDonald was arrested Monday night after veering off the road and crashing her car into a wooden fence in Dummerston, Vermont .\nThe Shelburne, Massachusetts woman claimed to have been talking on the phone and taking down directions when she crashed .\nPolice smelled alcohol on her and when they administered a breathalyzer test, MacDonald tested .02 per cent over the legal limit .", "pred_summary": "Linda MacDonald, 55, from Shelburne, Massachusetts was arrested after she ran off the road and crashed into a fence.\nShe told police she was on the phone and trying to take directions on a legal note pad.\nWhen officers smelled alcohol on MacDonald, they administered a breathalyzer test and she posted a.10 blood-alcohol content."}

{"article": "The future of travel will be virtual. Never again will you need to board a plane to be able to take in the world's most breathtaking locales, at least if Facebook has anything to say about it. In a recent Q&A on the social media site, CEO and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, opened up about the future of travel and how virtual reality will play a key role. According to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, the future of travel lies in sharing virtual reality environments . 'It will be pretty wild,' Zuckerberg replied to a follower online, according to arynews.tv. 'Just like we capture photos and videos today and then share them on the Internet to let others experience them too, we'll be able to capture whole 3D scenes and create new environments and then share those with people as well.' Zuckerberg's views of the future of virtual travel are perhaps unsurprising, considering that the social media giant purchased virtual reality headset maker, Oculus, last year. And at a conference in San Francisco last month, Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, promised that virtual reality gaming would be coming 'this year.' Never again will you need to endure a long-haul flight to take in some of Thailand's best beaches . Thanks to the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, users will be able to see the world from multiple viewpoints . Facebook also announced plans to begin supporting virtual reality on its newsfeed, meaning that users will be able to put on a VR headset and explore a location of their choosing. These videos are expected to be filmed with multiple cameras, so users will be able to change their viewpoints, allowing for even more in-depth exploration. Described as a 'first step,' it's also believed that even more immersive videos are on the horizon, including those which will use Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset that straps over your eyes. 'VR is more than just another platform, it can create a whole range of human experiences,' said Michael Abrash, the Chief Scientist at Oculus. The Facebook founder isn't the first to predict virtual reality as the future of travel. Marriott hotels have already trialled Oculus Rift on a tour of hotels across America, allowing guests to sample different holiday destinations.", "reference": "In recent Facebook Q&A, Zuckerberg discussed the future of travel .\nExpects that a greater emphasis will be on sharing 3D virtual reality scenes .\nLast year, Facebook purchased virtual reality headset marker, Oculus .", "pred_summary": "Mark Zuckerberg predicts the future of travel lies in sharing virtual reality environments.\nFacebook bought virtual reality headset maker, Oculus, last year.\nChief technology officer Mike Schroepfer promised virtual reality gaming would be coming 'this year'"}
{"article": "A year after he launched his own app and made headlines, Leo Grand is still homeless . On the night he launched his first app, a homeless man predicted that his life was going to change. 'I can work at Google, I can work at SpaceX,' Leo Grand gleefully stated minutes after his carpooling app Trees for Cars went live. 'This will change my life in a magnificent way.' It's been a year and a half since that moment led to Grand and his mentor, Patrick McConlogue, becoming media sensations. But Trees for Cars is no longer available, and Grand is still homeless, Mashable reported. In August 2013 McConlogue offered Grand, the homeless man he saw every day on his walk to work in New York City, a deal: He would either give him $100, or he would teach him how to code. Grand realized he could go through '$100 in a few days' and instead jumped at the opportunity to learn something new that he could then 'turn into something more,' he told Business Insider\u00a0in 2013. McConlogue provided Grand with daily lessons, as well as a laptop, wireless hot spot, coding books, a solar charger and office space at the start-up where he worked once it got too cold to type outside. Grand, who once said he wasn't 'the average homeless person' and that he considered himself 'eco-friendly', came up with an app designed to get more cars off the road. 'When I first launched my app it was good,' Grand told Mashable\u00a0this week. 'I was excited, the press was excited, it was just a great moment.' Grand and McConlogue appeared on TV shows, and he says people loved him everywhere and gave him free coffee at restaurants. Being on NBC, he said, was the highlight of his year. 'We got to stay in a nice hotel at Rockefeller Plaza. A nice, swanky hotel. We got the red carpet rolled out in front of us!' he said. But Grand is still living on the streets, and he said the number one question people ask him is why he's still homeless. Grand created Trees and Cars after\u00a0Patrick McConlogue offered him a deal: $100 in cash on the spot or daily coding lessons. Grand picked the latter, and was also provided a laptop, office space and coding books . But Grand is still living on the streets. He said the number one question people ask him is why he's still homeless . Trees for Cars only made Grand between $10,000 to 15,000 dollars, he said. And McConlogue has since taken a job in San Francisco, although he still meets up with Grand every time he's back in New York. The app is no longer in online stores because Grand does not want to pay for its server space. Grand instead uses the money he made from the app to pay for his storage space. He also keeps some possessions in a shopping cart. He insists that he likes living outdoors, although he said he plans to move into an apartment after he makes his second app. Grand said if he could do it all over again, he would have made a different app the first time around. 'I would've probably come up with a better idea for a mobile application that can generate a ton of revenue,' he told Mashable. For now, Grand said he does not code everyday anymore. He said 'life' is the reason for that. 'I've got the books, I've got the laptop, I've got the office space. I just haven't been able to get over there recently.' Grand, who gets by with welding jobs and worked for MetLife until he lost his job in 2011, once said the most hurtful thing someone could say to him was that he was dumb or not intelligent. 'Homelessness is not a feature of someone or a condition,' McConlogue said. 'It is something that people put a lot of people - in a lot of different situations - into one giant box.' Grand said if he could do it all over again, he would have 'come up with a better ideal' that would have generated more revenue.

But thanks to endless days of sun and temperatures we would not expect until August, English tomatoes and asparagus are already on the shelves, weeks ahead of usual. Waitrose announced yesterday the early arrival of its first British tomatoes of the year. It is stocking large Jack Hawkins, aromatic Red Choice and tiny Baby Plums, all grown in greenhouses across England. And the supermarket has been stocking asparagus since the beginning of the month.

{"article": "(CNN)Every day, images of war and conflict are splashed across our desktops, plastered on our TV screens and scattered through our mobile news feeds. Because of that, one's response to such imagery often becomes calloused or desensitized. This concept of \"how we digest images of war through mainstream media outlets,\" was what drove photographer Simon Brann Thorpe to begin his project \"Toy Soldiers.\" This idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of Western Sahara, a long-disputed region of northwestern Africa. Thorpe uses the area's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with. The soldiers are with the Polisario Front, an independence movement that has been clashing with Morocco over the region since the mid-1970s. Thorpe said his project enables \"the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional, physical and political response to war and conflict, when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers.\" Thorpe's background was not in photojournalism, but in landscape photography, which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between Morocco and the Polisario Front. \"The conflict in Western Sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there,\" Thorpe said. After a ceasefire in 1991, the people of Western Sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution. The people are split into two camps -- those living in Moroccan-occupied territory, and those in refugee camps in Algeria. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Thorpe had to get clearance to work with the Polisario Front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the United Nations. He usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time. The autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun. Thorpe would work with the troops' commander to position the men, then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images. They would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars. Not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project, but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on. Thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums. After the elaborate five-week production, Thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on \"how images of war (will) be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them.\" Simon Brann Thorpe's \"Toy Soldiers\" book is available for pre-order through Dewi Lewis Publishing.

The veteran ship even survived an atomic bomb test after being chosen as a 'target vessel' for Operation Crossroads on July 1, 1946. After taking part in yet another explosion, it was eventually decommissioned in August 1946 before its highly radioactive hull was taken to San Francisco five years later. Controversy surrounds its sinking as some believe the ship was loaded with barrels of radioactive waste that subsequently contaminated the wildlife in the Farallon Islands. 'After 64 years on the seafloor, Independence sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes,' said James Delgado chief scientist on the NOAA mission. He added: 'This ship fought a long, hard war in the Pacific and after the war was subjected to two atomic blasts that ripped through the ship. 'It is a reminder of the industrial might and skill of the \"greatest generation\" that sent not only this ship but their loved ones to war.' The carrier is one of an estimated 300 wrecks in the waters off San Francisco - and the deepest known shipwreck in the sanctuary, according to NOAA.

The review also slates the depiction of Catholic martyr Sir Thomas More, played by Anton Lesser in the show as an 'evidence-flouting caricature' that is 'sleazy, mean-spirited and just plain rude' A review for Catholic News Service, an agency of the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Conference said that the show encourages the audience to \u2018root for the self-made commoner Thomas Cromwell\u2019 when in fact he was a \u2018monster\u2019 who engineered a reign of terror and murdered anyone who stood in his way. In contrast, the drama\u2019s depiction of Sir Thomas More, a Catholic martyr, is \u2018not a pretty sight\u2019, said author Joseph McAleer. \u2018The future saint is barely recognisable: sleazy, mean-spirited and just plain rude,\u2019 he writes. \u2018This evidence-flouting caricature is light-years away from the man of principle.\u2019 A Washington Post reviewer warned the distortion of historical facts in Wolf Hall pointed to 'ideological bias' US media were generally looking forward to the historical drama being shows on Masterpiece PBS as a 'great British import', with Homeland star Damian Lewis as King Henry VIII and Claire Foy playing Anne Boleyn . Gregory Wolfe said that the adaptation of Hilary Mantel's book 'could obscure important lessons' The criticism from the U.S. Catholic Church follows that of Mark Davies and Mark O\u2019Toole, the Catholic Bishops of Shrewsbury and Plymouth, who said Wolf Hall was guilty of \u2018anti-Catholic\u2019 depictions of More, played by Anton Lesser, and for its whitewashing of Cromwell, the hero of the drama, played by Mark Rylance. Most U.S. media looked forward, however, to the opening episode of the series, broadcast on Masterpiece PBS last night, as a great British import co-starring Damien Lewis, the anti-hero Brody in the U.S. series Homeland, playing King Henry VIII.

{"article": "With its stuffed rhino heads and gleaming white tusks, the trophy room at Sandringham was a relic of a bygone era \u2013 as well as rather embarrassing for animal welfare crusader Prince William. But now the age of political correctness appears to have caught up with the Queen\u2019s Norfolk estate. For every last piece of hunting memorabilia has been removed from public display and replaced with what one visitor called \u2018trinkets and bric-a-brac\u2019. Throwback: How the trophy room at Sandringham used to look, complete with stuffed rhino heads . Bric-a-brac: Sandringham's updated display - and even the blood-red walls have been repainted white .

Even the blood-red walls have been painted white, as if to make clear the break with the past. The drastic change was apparent when the estate reopened its doors to the public on Saturday. Following the winter closure, a new sign outside the Sandringham museum makes pointed reference to how changing times have spelled the end for some exhibits. After explaining that the museum opened in 1928 to house George V\u2019s collection of \u2018big game trophies\u2019, the message says: \u2018Thankfully, due to the work of organisations like the World Wide Fund for Nature, whose President was HRH Prince Philip until 1996, this destructive era is drawing to a close \u2013 the camera having replaced the gun in recording the sightings of these magnificent animals.\u2019 Questions were raised in December about the legality of \u2018unworked items\u2019 \u2013 those not fundamentally changed from their natural state \u2013 dating from prior to 1947. Under a European Council regulation, the uncarved ivory, stuffed lions and white rhinos all potentially broke the law as they were not on show with an official certificate. The Animal and Plant Health Agency \u2013 an arm of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \u2013 confirmed there was a \u2018potential legal question mark\u2019 about some of the contents of the room. Bygone era: The room, which featured stuffed lions, must have been embarrassing for animal welfare crusader Prince William . Chnging times: Now every last piece of hunting memorabilia has been removed from public display . The situation was particularly embarrassing for Prince William, who had just denounced the illegal wildlife trade in ivory, rhino horn and endangered animal parts during a speech in Washington DC. He had also previously called for the Royal Family\u2019s ivory collection to be destroyed. And the royals now appear to have taken decisive action by removing the items from display \u2013 but whether their replacements are particularly interesting is another matter entirely. The new items include an ashtray used by King George V, a Sandringham Cycling Club badge dating from 1895 and an embroidered cover of Radio Times that marked the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. An ornate cabinet of \u2018curios\u2019 from a primary school on the estate contains dolls, jewellery made from oyster shells and a dried puffer fish. The only other creatures to be found are stuffed birds in a glass cabinet and a butterfly collection.

{"article": "Kate Winslet faces a planning battle with Natural England over plans to build sea defences . Kate Winslet is to face a battle with Natural England over plans to build a 550ft-long wall to protect her \u00a33.25 million beachside home from flooding and erosion. The multi BAFTA-winning actress, 39, wants to install a boulder and gravel seawall along the West Sussex coast to protect her property. But Natural England has recommended the planning application be refused - citing concerns  it may result in the 'direct loss' of natural habitat\u00a0designated for rare and vulnerable birds, trees and wetlands. The Academy Award-winning actress bought the eight bedroom house in West Sussex in 2013. She lives there with her husband, Richard Branson's nephew Ned Rocknroll, and her three children. But the environmental body has recommended her local District Council reject the application because of concerns over the impact it will have on the natural habitat. It is also unclear what effect the sea wall would have on a public footpath that runs along the bottom of the estate by the seashore. The shoreline is currently unprotected. The actress' Grade II-listed home backs onto a site that is a designated special protection area to safeguard wildlife living along the coast.\u00a0Wildlife  include waders, geese, ducks, herons, terns and cormorants. It is also in a 'Ramsar site', according to Natural England - which are protected under Government policy as 'proposed or listed wetlands of international importance.' The application is one of a number of requests previously submitted to the council for extensive renovation work at the house including the building of an underground swimming pool, garage and pool house. The planning document states: 'The proposed privately funded sea defences will ensure that the existing vegetation and public footpath will be protected into the future.

{"article": "Ukip 'hates modern Britain' and is infected with the 'virus of racism', rising Labour star Chuka Umunna has claimed. The shadow business secretary said Nigel Farage had 'a problem with race' following his remarks last about 'fully black' and 'half black' Ukip supporters. Mr Umunna's remarks come after Mr Farage dragged into a fresh racism storm after National Front members turned up to campaign for him in his South Thanet constituency. Scroll down for video . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Nigel Farage had 'a problem with race' following his remarks last about 'fully black' and 'half black' Ukip supporters . The row started after a group of far-Right supporters calling themselves the East Kent English Patriots supported Mr Farage at an event in Broadstairs on Friday evening. They were led by Gary Field, a former regional organiser for the English Defence League, and enjoyed the protection of Ukip's security teams, which encircled the Broadstairs Pavilion. Mr Field, who has a criminal record for assault, drank beers behind the cordon with fellow members of his group and gestured to onlookers as a crowd waited for Mr Farage's arrival. The Ukip leader moved to disown the far-right campaigners, saying: 'Members of an extremist group today arrived at a Ukip public meeting at the same time as a Mail on Sunday camera arrives.' But Labour's Mr Umunna, whose father was born in Nigeria, accused Ukip of whipping up 'anti-immigration sentiment'. Mr Umunna said: 'The likes of Ukip don't like what modern Britain is. They claim to love Britain, but they hate modern Britain. If I'm wrong about that why do we see a stream of invective directed at different groups in society from their candidates and their members? 'There is a virus of racism which runs through that party which they've failed to deal with, and I'm not surprised given their leader doesn't see the need for equalities legislation that we have in Britain today and that we're very proud of.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage, stopping for a pint in Ramsgate, Kent, was accused of having a 'problem with race' Gary Field, a former regional organiser for the English Defence League (pictured in the white hat)\u00a0turned up to campaign for Ukip in South Thanet constituency last week . Last week, Mr Farage defended Ukip's manifesto, which featured only one ethnic-minority person, saying the party had one spokesman who was 'fully black' and another who was 'half black'. Responding to these remarks, Mr Umunna said: 'I just think the guy's got a problem with race. I'm just saying what I think. 'As a party they've got a problem with race. And I don't think you can kick out racism from their party unless you have got a leadership which understands it and understands race in modern Britain. 'I have no truck with this notion that immigrants are to blame for all of the country's problems.

{"article": "(CNN)It's clear from Hillary Clinton's campaign rollout -- a video announcement/campaign ad/short film that debuted Sunday afternoon -- that she will make women and being a woman central to her outreach. In case you're skeptical, Vox has posted a handy \"by the numbers\" for her campaign video, and there are 38 people besides Clinton in the two-minute ad. Twenty of them are women. There are three separate mentions of motherhood. This is all fine and good (and predictable) if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980. And let's not overlook the fact that Clinton is in fact a woman, and that's a fine thing to celebrate. But in reality, she doesn't have to wonder if a woman-centered campaign is the best strategy. She can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible-voting population failed spectacularly all over the country, in red and blue states, when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates. As I've previously written, the 2014 midterm elections saw the death of a political meme: the \"war on women.\" Granted, that's not because Republicans convinced the country that they were the party of women. But it is noteworthy that Democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues (and men) crashed and burned. To wit: . In Colorado, Sen. Mark Udall was nicknamed \"Mark Uterus\" for all the time he spent fear-mongering on women's reproductive issues, only to end up, according to exit polls, eight points ahead among women. His opponent, Cory Gardner, finished 17 points ahead among men. In New York, a Democratic candidate for Congress, Martha Robertson, drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a \"war on women.\" To repeat, she was a woman, a Democrat, in New York. In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for Democrats' lack of popularity in the South. Not surprisingly, Southerners voted for her opponent, Bill Cassidy. In Texas, where liberal Wendy Davis ran almost entirely on an abortion-rights platform, she accused Republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography. Her opponent, Greg Abbott, won by 20 points, and Davis only ended up with 47% of the women vote. Whether in Texas or Colorado, New York or Louisiana, voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and weren't going to be bullied into voting Democratic by false cries of sexism. But while Democrats were screaming about the Republicans' \"war on women,\" few in the media acknowledged that the Democrats' deficit among men was actually greater than the Republicans' deficit among women. Exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for Republicans over Democrats by a 16-point margin, and women voted for Democrats by only a four-point margin. Regardless of whom Republicans run for president, Hillary Clinton will most likely get the women vote. What she needs are men. So instead of running a woman-centered campaign, she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex.", "reference": "S.E.

Letourneau, 53, and her husband, Vili Fualaau, 31, will talk about her rape trial  and their married life in an interview with Barbara Walters on '20/20', which will air on Friday. The former Seattle teacher shot to infamy after starting a relationship with Fualaau when he was a 12-year-old sixth-grade student and falling pregnant with his child when he was just 13. After she served a seven-year prison term for the relationship, they married and now have two children together. She also has four children from a previous marriage. Scroll down for video . Speaking out:\u00a0Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau and her husband Vili Fualaau have spoken to Barbara Walters in an interview that will air on 20/20 on Friday - nearly 20 years after\u00a0Letourneau's arrest for the relationship . Family: The couple's two teenage daughters, Georgia and Audrey, will join their parents for the interview . Their two daughters, Audrey and Georgia, who are now both teenagers, will join their parents for the interview, ABC News said. While speaking with Walters, Letourneau will discuss her plans to get her status as a registered sex offender lifted, as well as her hopes to teach again one day. She will also talk out about how they make their marriage work despite the 21-year age gap, ABC News reported. Fualaau will discuss his struggle with alcoholism and depression and how he believes he was failed by the system as a minor. After his teacher was convicted, his family filed a lawsuit against the police department and the school district for failing to protect him from sexual exploitation. No damages were awarded. Relationship: The duo first met when\u00a0Fualaau (pictured in 1998) was in second grade and went on to have a sexual relationship when he was 12 and\u00a0Letourneau (right in a 1996 school photo) was his teacher .

She fell pregnant with their first daughter before she was arrested and with their second after she was released . Reunited: Letourneau is pictured with her daughter Audrey during a prison visit in 2003 . The pair originally met when he was in her second grade class and then she taught him again in sixth grade in 1996. As she taught him, their relationship turned sexual and a friend of her husband's ultimately went to the police with his suspicions. But before she was arrested, she fell pregnant with the boy's child and gave birth to his first daughter, Audrey, while she was on bail in May 1997 while waiting for the outcome of her trial. She was sentenced to six months in county jail - although three were suspended - and was ordered to have no contact with the boy. But weeks after he release, she was found having sexual relations with him in her car and fell pregnant with their second daughter. Family: She was married and had four children before the affair. She is pictured, right, with one of her sons . Back together: The couple is pictured during a photo shoot at their Normandy Park, Washington home in 2006. She was released from jail in 2004 and they got married a year later . At home: The couple is pictured with their daughters as they drive near their home near Seattle in 2005 .

James Ritchie was voted into the job at the Tasmanian University Union with a clear majority over a female candidate more than three weeks ago. Despite his qualifications for the role and no gender specified in the job description, the reaction to a male being offered the position caused huge opposition which left Mr Ritchie feeling that the negativity impacted on him being able to do the job to the best of his ability. James Ritchie was forced to resign from his role as women's officer for the\u00a0Tasmanian University Union after public pressure and an online petition opposed the decision to employ a male for the job . 'There has been a lot of public pressure for me to resign, a lot of interest groups that want me to resign,' Mr Ritchie told ABC radio. 'But the main thing for me was I felt my ability to be effective in the role was now diminished and that's the most fundamental thing.' The university's Women's Collective had launched a petition on the website\u00a0change.org to have Mr Ritchie removed from his role in the TUU. The petition said Mr Ritchie 'was elected to the role of women's officer unconstitutionally and unethically and yet the TUU staff refuses to disqualify his candidacy'. However, TUU guidelines did not state a preferred gender for the role, saying only that 'an interest in higher education and student issues would be advantageous'. The university's student union has now introduced a requirement that candidates sign a statutory declaration confirming they identify as female . The state's anti-discrimination commissioner, Robin Banks, also said there was no legal reason why a man could not occupy the role of women's officer. 'In my opinion, it's irrelevant if (the position is) held by a female or a male. In this election I believe I was the best person for the role,' Mr Ritchie said.

{"article": "A vaccine has been developed to help prevent the recurrence of prostate cancer (cells pictured) A vaccine has been developed to help prevent the recurrence of prostate cancer, and potentially other cancers. It's designed to teach the immune system to recognise compounds found in prostate cancer cells and is being given to men who have already been treated for the cancer. The vaccine is made from pieces of a protein called TARP that's found in about 95 per cent of prostate cancers. Animal studies have shown that the protein can effectively stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer. The thinking is that the vaccine will prime the immune system so that it creates antibodies when it detects TARP-related cancers. Then, should the cancer reappear, the antibodies will be dispatched to attack the malignant cells. Those antibodies, along with other immune cells, can then destroy cancer cells without harming non-cancer cells, so minimising side-effects. It is initially being tested as a way to treat cancer that has returned but, if successful, could be used as a first line treatment for prostate and potentially breast cancer in the future. TARP is also found in about 50 per cent of breast cancers. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. In many cases the cancer develops slowly and patients may simply be monitored rather than actively treated. But in cases where the cancer is more aggressive, even after treatment there is a high risk of recurrence. Researchers at the U.S. National Cancer Institute are using the vaccine on 70 men who have been treated for the cancer, but whose PSA is rising again (posed by model) Once they have been treated, men are monitored with regular blood tests that check for a protein called prostate specific antigen or PSA, which can indicate cancer. The time it takes for the PSA reading to double is called the PSADT. Men with a PSADT of less than three months are at high risk of dying from prostate cancer. Around 11,000 men in the UK die from the disease a year. Researchers at the U.S. National Cancer Institute are using the vaccine on 70 men who have been treated for the cancer, but whose PSA is rising again. Men on the trial will have a PSADT greater than three months and less than 15. The trial will last nearly two years, and men will be given six injections of the vaccine or a placebo during that time. The number of\u00a0men in Britain\u00a0with, or who have had, prostate\u00a0cancer . Professor Raj Persad, urology consultant at the Bristol Urological Institute, says that the idea of boosting the body's own immune defences is an 'excellent strategy' for preventing a recurrence of the disease. 'Toxicity studies will have to be done, and then clinical effectiveness studies are needed, and it will need to be compared to existing treatments,' he says. 'But despite these time constraints, the research looks very promising indeed and we must watch this space.' Meanwhile, the MMR vaccine may be a new way to tackle problem warts. Researchers have found that injecting the vaccine into warts that have resisted other treatments leads to six out of ten disappearing. Warts are caused by infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Although they can clear up without treatment within one to two years, about a third or more do not resolve and may multiply and enlarge, making treatment more difficult. In the new study, researchers used the jab on 65 patients who'd had warts for between two and 15 years. They had an average of three treatments. In 63 per cent of cases, the warts disappeared, while 6 per cent showed no response. The remainder had some improvement. Side-effects included pain during injection, itching and flu-like symptoms. The warts recurred in only two patients, according to the researchers from Zagazig University, Egypt, whose findings are published in the International Journal of Dermatology. The theory is that the vaccine stimulates the immune system, which then spots and attacks the HPV virus and the warts it had previously overlooked.", "reference": "Vaccine is made from pieces of a protein called TARP .\nTARP is found in about 95 per cent of prostate cancers .\nStudies show the protein can teach the immune system to attack cancer .", "pred_summary": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year.\nThe vaccine is made from pieces of a protein called TARP that's found in about 95% of prostate cancers.\nAnimal studies have shown it can effectively stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer."}

{"article": "No need to call the cops, the three men caught on camera smoking marijuana in an entertaining new video are actually former police offers themselves - and, of course, the substance that they're lighting up is completely legal. Recorded in the state of Washington, where recreational use of marijuana was legalized in July of last year, the video, created by YouTube channel Cut, sees each of the three ex-cops taking hits from a bong, before offering their thoughts, both funny and thoughtful, on the controversial substance. 'It's like the last piece of prohibition,' says Robert, 73, who worked as a police officer from 1970 to 1986 before performing criminal justice training for another decade. 'I think it should be legal [and] I think it should be more widely available for medical reasons.' Scroll down for video . Doobie discussions: Former police officers Rene, left, Robert, center, and David, right, discuss marijuana while smoking from a bong in a new video produced by Cut . Released on April 20, which is affectionately referred to as 420, a day widely regarded by marijuana users as the national day for getting high, the video shows the three men smoking several times over the course of a few hours while discussing the drug, eating snacks, and playing games, including crude card game Cards Against Humanity. 'I tried it once and I tell you, I was on a waterbed with a very agreeable woman and listening to Rhapsody in Blue, which I know lasts for about 18 minutes and 40 seconds, and it lasted for, oh hell, two or three hours,' says Robert. David, who served as a reserve police officer from 1997 to 2004, says he smoked for the first time at the age 14, but stopped for a while afterward because he got caught. 'The last time I smoked was probably in 1968 when I was in college,' says Rene, 67, who was on the force from 1970 to 1997. Celebrating 420: The video was released on April 20, which is regarded by many smokers as the national day to get high . They've got the munchies: The three ex-cops snacked on chips and cookies while they smoked and talked for several hours . In between bong hits and self-administered field sobriety tests, the trio debates the dangers and benefits of using marijuana. Rene says that one argument for\u00a0legalizing the drug is knowing what you're getting when you buy it; he explains that when people get it on the street, they don't always know what their marijuana has been cut with. Sometimes it can be mixed with more dangerous substances. While they disagree on whether it's a gateway drug - Robert notes that every heroin addict started out drinking milk, implying that it's difficult to link the use of one product to another - they all seem to agree that legal\u00a0repercussions\u00a0for using marijuana do more harm than good. 'It costs more to put someone in prison than it does to send someone to Harvard,' says Robert, suggesting that sending people to prison for marijuana possession or distribution is a wasteful drain on society. 'As far as I can remember, I never arrested anyone for it, but I took a lot of pot away from people and threw it away in front of them,' says Rene, adding that he thought that his personal punishment was a bigger deterrent than writing them a citation. Pot partakers: Rene, left, says he never wrote a criminal citation to someone with marijuana, but would throw out their drugs in front of them; while he served, it was illegal in every state . Special cause: The video links to Shona Banda's GoFundMe page, which is raising money for the Kansas mother's legal defense; her 11-year-old son was taken away from her for discussing medical marijuana . At one point, the interviewer tells the former officers that some people report feeling sexually aroused when they smoke. 'I'm 73 years old, I don't know what the hell you're talking about!' answers Robert. 'It's been so long since I've made love, I can't remember who ties up whom!' While the ex-cops' cracks are certainly meant to elicit laughs, the video also aims to promote the\u00a0GoFundMe page of activist\u00a0Shona Banda. The Kansas mother's 11-year-old son was taken away from her late last month when, during a drug discussion at his school, he extolled the benefits of medical  marijuana.

Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules.

The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son,\u00a0who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It\u2019s very black and white. There\u2019s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don\u2019t have emotions, but they do.

{"article": "Teenage girls do better in single sex schools as they can focus on their work rather than impressing boys, a leading headmistress says. Rhiannon Wilkinson, head of Wycombe Abbey in Buckinghamshire reportedly said that a 'boy free' environment stops girls from being held back by the opposite sex, who are known to mature slower. She also suggested that single-sex boarding schools give pupils relief and protection from the 'highly sexualised world' and allow them to 'remain girls for longer.' 'My wide educational experience in both mixed and girls' schools has shown me clearly that girls are best served educationally in their teenage years in a boy-free work environment,' she said according to the Telegraph. Rhiannon Wilkinson, the head of Wycombe Abbey in Buckinghamshire, pictured, claims a 'boy free' environment allows teenage girls to focus on their work . She added: 'In co-ed environments lots of girls when adolescence kicks want to be liked by boys not just for their intelligence and want to be popular with boys. But she said in all girl environments pupils are 'free from that,' according to the Telegraph. Two years ago Scientists at Newcastle University found that girls really do mature faster than boys. They discovered that as the brain matures it begins to 'prune' information that is stored and focus on what is important. Tony Little, head at Eton College, has previously said that single sex schools allow children to retain their 'innocence' For girls this can happen as early as 10 years old, but for boys it can take until between 15 and 20 for the same. Tony Little, the head of Eton College, has also spoken of the benefits of single sex schools. He said they allow children to retain their 'innocence' and be 'themselves' for longer. 'What does strike me is that in a single-sex environment, particularly at the age of 13, 14, 15, there is an opportunity for both boys and girls to be themselves for longer. To be 'boyish' for longer, to be young girls,' he said, according to the BBC. Boys could also benefit from being taught separately. Statistics have shown that boys often lag behind girls at both GCSE and A-level and are much less likely to apply to university. Alun Jones, the first male president of the Girls' Schools Association, has previously called for teenage boys  to be taught in single sex classes in state schools. Mr Jones, who is also a schools inspector, said: 'If you have a very bright, very driven, very focused, very articulate lady, which a lot of girls are, that intimidates a boy in the classroom, especially boys of average ability. 'The result is that boys don't put their hands up to answer questions or they indulge in immature behaviour to avoid being shown up. Boys are falling behind as girls are doing better.'", "reference": "'Boy free' environment stops girls from being held back by opposite sex .\nGirls in single sex education don't have to worry about impressing boys .\nComments made by head of Wycombe Abbey School in Buckinghamshire .\nCome after calls for boys to be taught separately in state schools .", "pred_summary": "Rhiannon Wilkinson says girls are best served in a 'boy-free work environment'\nHead of Wycombe Abbey says it allows girls to focus on their work rather than impressing boys.\nEton College head Tony Little has also praised single sex schools."}

Sikander Rafiq, 34, and Samara Jabreen, 32, lied to Birmingham City\u00a0Council about their relationship in a scam spanning an eight year period.

Sikander Rafiq, 34, and Samara Jabreen, 32, lied to Birmingham City Council about their relationship in a scam spanning an eight year period. The couple, from Ward End, pocketed \u00a366,268 housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support . Birmingham Crown Court heard Jabreen first lodged a genuine claim for\u00a0income support in 2002. But three years later, when Rafiq bought them a house, Jabreen\u00a0claimed to be a private tenant and asked that her benefit payments be made\u00a0to her landlord, Rafiq. Blondelle Thompson, prosecuting, said Jabreen also signed declarations saying neither she nor her children were related to\u00a0Rafiq. She even claimed single occupancy discount on her council tax payments, the\u00a0court was told. Jabreen pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to notify a change of\u00a0circumstances and a charge of making a false representation. Rafiq admitted a charge of furnishing false information regarding the\u00a0tenancy agreement provided to the city council. But after hearing of her ill-health and that she was the sole carer for\u00a0their children, Jabreen was spared prison. She was sentenced to 22 weeks, suspended for 18 months, placed under supervision for 18 months and ordered to attend the Anawim probation\u00a0project for 30 days. Rafiq, it was heard, acted out of desperation to pay their mortgage rather\u00a0than through greed. He was handed an 18-month sentence, suspended for 18\u00a0months and ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work.

In October 2011 a report was made to the city council's fraud investigation\u00a0team, prompting an investigation.

Life insurance documents and a Virgin Media account were both registered to\u00a0Rafiq at the couple's address.

The final of the European Challenge Cup is now tantalisingly within reach for Alan Solomons\u2019 side after their heroic quarter-final triumph over London Irish. Only Newport Gwent Dragons stand in their way in what will be a tough semi-final at BT Murrayfield in a fortnight. Should the Scots prevail, they will head for Twickenham Stoop - home of Harlequins for whom winger Visser signed a two-year deal this month. Tim Visser was a key player in Edinburgh's dramatic win over London Irish at the Madejski Stadium . \u2018The Stoop is going to be my future home ground and it would be great to get to know it by playing a final there,\u2019 he said. \u2018For that to be one of my final games for Edinburgh and to pick up silverware would make things pretty special, really emotional and a great end to my time at the club. \u2018Helping Edinburgh bring the first major trophy back home would be the perfect way to give back something to the club, to repay them for all they have done through the years, all the good friends I have made, all the good memories.\u2019 Scotland cap Visser was one of Edinburgh\u2019s key men in the dramatic win at the Madejski Stadium.

VIsser is hopeful he can end his Edinburgh career at the ground he will call home from next season .

Edinburgh will have to see off\u00a0Newport Gwent Dragons if they are to reach the final at the Stoop . \u2018The Edinburgh of old would have probably let that through and we would have lost. \u2018We work hard for each other.

{"article": "A violent thug who went on the run before taunting police by posing on Facebook in a silver wig and Dame Edna Everage-style sunglasses has been jailed for a second time. Michael Easy, 29, from Southampton, Hampshire, sparked a nationwide police manhunt after going on the run in 2013 after attacking a woman at a party. While on the run, he posted photographs of himself on Facebook posing in a platinum wig and pink Dame Edna Everage-style glasses under the profile name of Michelle. The image showed him pressing his finger to his lips - taunting police as they had failed to track him down. Michael Easy, 29, from Southampton, Hampshire (pictured), sparked a major police manhunt after going on the run and taunted police by posing in Dame Edna-style glasses and a platinum wig in Facebook photos . Easy posted the photograph of himself in a wig and pink sunglasses under the Facebook name 'Michelle Dirt' However, officers eventually found him and he was jailed for 15 months - but he went on the run again in December last year upon his release. Officers arrested him once again and he is now facing the next four months in jail for breaching a restraining order and assaulting two prison officers during his first stint behind bars. The court heard Easy breached the restraining order when he was seen leaving a party with his former girlfriend, aged 19, in December last year. Her family called the police because they were concerned for her safety as Easy had been found guilty in January 2013 of assaulting her when she was pregnant with his child - although in court Easy disputed the child, who is now in care, was his. Southampton Magistrates' Court heard he was due in court for a trial concerning these charges in February, but failed to appear. He was convicted in his absence and a police manhunt was launched. He was found nine days later. Mark Florida-James, defending Easy for his latest crimes, told the court that his former girlfriend had told him she thought the restraining order was over and that she obliged in leaving the party with him. Easy (pictured) is now facing four months in jail after breaching a restraining order and assaulting two prison guards while at Winchester Prison . The crown applied for a new order to be imposed, with prosecuting solicitor Louise Holmes telling the hearing that Easy's former girlfriend, who cannot be named, is 'extremely vulnerable' and has learning difficulties. Ms Holmes said: 'Mr Easy's history and his previous convictions clearly show he is a man of violence towards women and his partners.' The court was handed a statement from Easy's former partner asking not to impose the restraining order, but Ms Holmes told the court that police believed she did this because she is worried for her safety. District Judge Anthony Callaway refused to impose another restraining order, telling the court the woman concerned is an adult who can make her own decisions. The court also heard how Easy assaulted two male prison officers at Winchester Prison in November last year after they tried to take him back to his cell when he became argumentative and disruptive. Easy - a serial offender who has more than 27 convictions to his name - found himself behind bars for 15 months after kicking and slapping his former girlfriend at a party. During his time in prison, he struck a guard in the face, causing swelling to his cheek, after being told to stop jumping on the net installed between prison floors to prevent suicides. In another incident, he also struck another prison officer in the face, causing facial swelling and a shoulder injury which required treatment. Mr Florida-James said: 'Mr Easy seems to attract trouble, he causes trouble, he admits that. 'He's now quite keen to have some sort of diagnosis to try to help him with these problems.' Judge Callaway sentenced Easy to 56 days for the 'serious' breach of the restraining order and a total of 56 days for assaulting the prison officers, to run consecutively. He gave no sentence for failing to surrender.", "reference": "Michael Easy first went on the run in 2013 after assaulting a woman at party .\nWhile hiding from police, he taunted them by posting photos on Facebook .\nCaught and jailed for 15 months before going on run again on his release .\nNow facing four months in jail for assault and breaching restraining order .", "pred_summary": "Michael Easy was jailed for 15 months in 2013 for attacking a woman at a party.\nHe went on the run again in December last year andaunted police as they failed to track him down.\nThe serial offender has more than 27 convictions to his name."}

{"article": "The alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attack which left 166 dead has been released on bail, Pakistani officials revealed. Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi was allowed to leave Adiala Prison in Rawalpindi\u00a0late on Thursday. His release was slammed with Indians calling it an 'insult' to the victims of the three-day onslaught, which was blamed on the banned Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Pakistani security personnel escort Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, as he leaves court after a hearing in Islamabad on January 1 . LeT's charitable wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), confirmed Lakhvi's release. A senior JuD official said: 'Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi has been released from jail. He is free now and in a secure place. We can't say exactly where he is at the moment for security reasons.' Another official said Lakhvi would receive a hero's welcome when he arrived at JuD headquarters. It comes after nearly four months of wrangling over Lakhvi's detention after a judge granted him bail in December, sparking an angry response from New Delhi. Pakistan's government slapped Lakhvi with a series of detention orders but judges repeatedly cancelled them. On Thursday the Lahore High Court ordered his release, conditional on a two million rupee (32,000 U.S. dollars or \u00a322,000) bond. India has long seethed at Pakistan's failure either to hand over or prosecute those accused of planning and organising the Mumbai attacks. A spokesman for India's home ministry, who asked not to be named, condemned Lakhvi's release. They said: 'This is a very disappointing announcement. An insult to the victims of the 26/11 Mumbai attack. The global community should take serious note of Pakistan's double-speak on terrorism.' Pakistan foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasneem Aslam blamed India for delaying the case.

Debris and burnt out cars litter the street at the site of a blast in Coilaba, a market in downtown Mumbai on November 26, 2008 . The horror of the Mumbai carnage played out on live television as commandos battled around ten heavily armed gunmen, who arrived by sea on the evening of November 26, 2008. The gunmen carried out twelve coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days, and killing 166 people. They targeted guests at two five star hotels, a Jewish centre and commuters at the city's main railway station. It took the authorities three days to regain full control of the city. Nine of the gunmen were killed. She said: 'Inordinate delay in extending cooperation by India complicated the case and weakened the prosecution.' Lakhvi and six other suspects were charged in Pakistan - but their cases have made little progress in five years. Delhi has long accused Islamabad of prevaricating over the trials, while Pakistan has alleged that India failed to give it crucial evidence. Lakhvi's initial bail order in December prompted an angry response from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said it came as 'a shock to all those who believe in humanity'. Pakistani analyst Hasan Askari said he was at a loss to understand why the case had not been resolved. Map detailing the 2008 Mumbai attacks and a photo of Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the man suspected of organising them . He said: 'The government must settle this case once for all and face the international community. 'It's strange that this case has not been decided since 2009.' New Delhi has long said there is evidence that 'official agencies' in Pakistan were involved in plotting the attack.

{"article": "The biblical-style ramblings of accused killer Charles Severance, 54, were revealed during his court appearance on Thursday (pictured) An accused serial killer's rambling manifesto revealed details of his chilling plan to 'Knock. Talk. Enter. Kill. Exit. Murder', a prosecutor has said. Charles Severance, 54, who has been charged with the murders of Nancy Dunning, Ron Kirby and Ruthanne Lodato, in Alexandria, Virginia, was in court for a hearing on Thursday. All three victims were gunned down at their homes in daylight attacks: Dunning in 2003, Kirby in 2013 and Lodato last year. At court on Thursday, prosecutor Bryan Porter argued Severance, who was once a fringe candidate for political office, should face just one trial as his writings linked the three murders,The Washington Post\u00a0reported. Severance's writing appeared to echo a biblical passage and also included the words: 'The last scream of a victim echoes to eternity... Murder on my mind, and my mind on murder.' The prosecution alleged that Severance's plan to kill was outlined in a bizarre piece called 'Parable of the Knocker', based on a bible passage called Parable of the Midnight Knocker. Judge Jane Marum Roush also decided at the hearing that Severance's trial should be moved from Alexandria to Fairfax County because the possibility of an impartial jury seemed unlikely after the hysteria which surrounded the murders. Severance was arrested in March 2014 over the murders after he sought asylum at the Russian Embassy in D.C.\u00a0He was reportedly 'sent away' from the embassy and told he was an 'unwanted guest'. Accused serial killer Charles Severance, 54, had several outbursts at his court hearing on Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia and was reprimanded by the judge . Alleged  serial killer Charles Severance was escorted out following a hearing in his case at the Alexandria Circuit Court on Thursday. His trial will be moved to Fairfax County, a judge ruled, over fears for an impartial jury due to the hysteria surrounding the murders . The murders caused panic among the residents of the wealthy Washington D.C. suburb of Alexandria after they were warned by authorities that a serial killer was on the loose. The shootings were random but took place just blocks from each other when the victims opened their front doors at the same time of day. Ruthanne Lodato, a married mother-of-three, was killed on February 6 last year after a man knocked on her door at 11.30am and opened fire on her and a nurse caring for her mother. Lodato, 59, was rushed to hospital in critical condition but did not survive. The nurse, who was shot in the arm, gave police a description of their bearded attacker. Several months earlier, in November 2013, regional transportation planner Ronald Kirby, 69, was shot dead at his home. In December 2003, real estate agent Nancy Dunning, 56, was gunned down. Ballistics revealed similarities in bullet fragments at the three murder scenes. Pictured left, Ruthanne Lodato, 59, a married mother-of-three, was shot dead at her home in Alexandria last year.

Similar bullet fragments were found at the murder scene to two killings years later, and a police sketch of a suspect released (right) Severance had built up anger after a court ruling in 2000 which banned him from having contact with his son, which he detailed on his personal website, MentalDisorder.com. On the website he claimed that mental health tests, which he refused to take, were conducted by, 'secular (demon possessed) humanist-priests, democracy government regulated mad-doctors, agents of psychiatry, and other weak hypocrites'. Alexandria Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Bryan Porter told the court on Thursday that Severance's anger drove him to kill, The Post reported. Defense attorneys argued for Ms Dunning's murder case to be tried separately but the prosecutor said that ballistics evidence and the defendant's writings made a connection between the three killings. During the court appearance on Thursday, Severance made frequent outbursts and was reprimanded by the judge. When discussing him making an obscene gesture at another court appearance, The Post reported that the defendant held up his middle finger and said: 'That\u2019s West Virginia. That\u2019s not an obscene gesture.' The trial is due to begin in October.

When the Washington couple's three-year-old had first began complaining of someone talking to him at night, his parents had put it down to their toddler's over-active imagination, reported CBS New York. That was until one night when they heard a strange man's voice come over the monitor to tell their son:\u00a0'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you.' A couple heard the terrifying message: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you' come through their 3-year-old son's baby monitor (stock image) And the horrified parents, who do not want to be named for fear the unknown man could track them down, believe it is not just the audio monitor that has been hacked. They believe the stranger has also got into the camera on the device. After the first creepy message, the boy's mother had walked into the room and overheard the hacker saying, 'Look someone's coming' or 'Someone's coming into view.' The mother said she broke down in tears after the\u00a0realization\u00a0hit home that a total stranger was able to control the\u00a0camera to watch their son and spy on them. The stranger had managed to hack the baby monitor and the family says the hacker was even able to remotely control the camera on the monitor (stock image) She told CBS New York:\u00a0'Well, I started to cry in there, because it all started coming back to me, and I started figuring things out.' They reported the\u00a0incident\u00a0to Foscam, the company where they bought their monitor, who admitted it was possible the device's cameras were being controlled\u00a0remotely\u00a0but they could not say from\u00a0where. Technology experts have now warned that it is becoming easier for hackers to infiltrate family's baby monitors as many of the newer devices connect to the internet. 'It's basically like they're standing next to you in your house,' Lance Ulanoff, chief correspondent for the digital media website Mashable,CBS. He warned that parents should change the passwords on the devices to make it more difficult for people to guess. Because some new baby monitors connect to the internet and come with a smartphone app, it has become easier for hackers to infiltrate them and listen in or speak to children . 'If somebody else has your login information, they can go to that same app, and log into your webcam, which is what happened here,' Ulanoff said. Earlier this month, another couple - this time from Rochester, Minnesota - discovered their baby monitors and cameras had been infiltrated after they found footage from the nanny cam posted online, according to Redbook. They first became suspicious after they heard music coming in from their baby's room. 'We were sleeping in bed, and basically heard music coming from the nursery, but then when we went into the room the music turned off,' she told KTTC. When she tracked down the IP address which was streaming the music, she found a web link to a page with thousands of pictures from baby monitors all over the world, including several from her own child's nursery. 'There's at least fifteen different countries listed and it's not just nurseries\u2014it's people's living rooms, their bedrooms, their kitchens,' she explained.

{"article": "(CNN)An American teenager who helped her boyfriend stuff her mother's lifeless body into a suitcase at an upmarket hotel in Bali has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Heather Mack, 19, who gave birth to her own daughter just weeks ago, was found guilty with her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack on the Indonesian island last August. Schaefer was sentenced to 18 years in prison for battering von Wiese-Mack to death in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort. Schaefer had claimed he killed his girlfriend's mother in self-defense after a violent argument erupted over the young couple's relationship. The beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found in a large silver suitcase that the couple had loaded in a waiting taxi outside the resort.  They told the driver they'd be back soon, but after a lengthy wait he alerted hotel staff who inspected the bag, noticed blood and called police. The lovers were arrested after being found the following morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers (nine miles) away. Inside the bag, von Wiese-Mack's body had been wrapped in hotel bedding. A forensic examination determined that she had died from a blunt force to the face that fractured her facial bones and caused her to suffocate. Described as a Chicago socialite, von Wiese-Mack was reported to have a troubled relationship with her teenage daughter. Schaefer denied that the murder was premeditated. He told the court that he acted in self-defense when his girlfriend's mother started strangling him during an argument in the Bali hotel room. \"She squeezed my neck for about 20 to 30 seconds. I couldn't breathe. I had blood going to my head and my eyes were so watery,\" Schaefer told the court. He said he reached for a nearby bowl \"before she could.\"  \"I couldn't see for a moment because my eyes were so watery and I was distraught, I was in a state of mind, I had no idea what was happening. I was almost about to black out. And I grabbed it and I started swinging,\" he told the court. Mack told the court her mother had threatened to kill the couple's unborn baby, according to local media. The prosecutor alleged that the two planned the murder, because Mack's mother disapproved of their relationship. After being detained by police, the couple initially claimed they'd been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Heather's mother, and from whom they managed to escape. The two were tried separately, though both trials were heard by the same court, with the same prosecutors. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 18 years for Schaefer and 15 years for Mack. Under Indonesian law, Mack will be allowed to keep her baby with her in prison for two years, after which she can nominate who should take custody. Journalists Fairuz Husaini and Ragil Lestari and CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.", "reference": "Heather Mack jailed for 10 years over mother's murder in Bali .\nBoyfriend Tommy Schaefer sentenced to 18 years in prison for the attack .\nMack gave birth to the couple's daughter last month .", "pred_summary": "Heather Mack, 19, found guilty of killing her girlfriend's mother in Bali last August.\nGirlfriend's 21-year-old boyfriend Tommy Schaefer sentenced to 18 years in prison.\nSchaefer claims he killed mother in self-defense after argument."}

A chess grandmaster has been thrown out of an international tournament and faces a 15-year ban after he was caught sneaking to the toilet to check moves on his mobile phone. Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his phone in the middle of a match. The two-time national champion was exposed when his opponent lodged a complaint when he grew suspicious about his frequent trips to the lavatory. Tournament organisers found Nigalidze had stored a mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper. They announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it. 'What they found was the mobile phone with headphones; the device was hidden behind the pan and covered with toilet paper.' Tournament organisers at the Dubai Open Chess tournament\u00a0announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page . When officials confronted the Georgian, he denied owning the device but officials found the phone was logged into a social networking site under his name. They also found his match being analysed in one of the chess applications. He was promptly removed from the tournament and could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game. When questioned about the offence,\u00a0Nigalidze said: 'Not everything is true in what Petrosian said'. This is not the first time a player was caught cheating at a chess tournament. In July 2013, Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov was suspended from playing for four months by his national federation. It had been found most of his moves matched those of the leading computer chess analysis programs. Two years earlier the French chess federation suspended three players, including the national team captain, when it was alleged they used text messages, a remote chess computer and coded signals to beat the opposition at the 2010 Chess Olympiad. In 2008, at the Dubai Open, an Iranian player was banned when he was found to be receiving help from someone watching the game's live broadcast on the internet and was sending the moves through text messages. Tournaments sanctioned by the International Chess Federation - including the Dubai Open - do not allow players to carry mobile phones and other electronic devices during matches.", "reference": "Gaioz Nigalidze has been expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament .\nGeorgian champion was found using his phone in the middle of a match .\nOpponent grew suspicious when he kept making trips to the toilet .\nTournament organisers then saw he had wrapped a phone in toilet paper .\nFound his match was being monitored in a chess application on the phone .", "pred_summary": "Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament.\nTournament organisers found mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper."}

It is the second such incident to emerge within two days, after a murderer was caught drinking prison hooch in a video he shared online. Scroll down for video . Jail: Prisoner Royston Coates has posted a string of photographs from inside his jail cell . Inmates: Coates posed up alongside another prisoner in one of the photos on Facebook . Prison authorities have now shut down the criminal's Facebook account after being alerted to the messages he has posted. Over the past six months, Coates has repeatedly sent out messages to his 300 Facebook friends updating them about his life inside jail. His messages reveal that he has been allowed to watch popular TV shows such as The X Factor and The Only Way Is Essex, as well as an England football match. Photographs taken last month show that he has a television set and DVD player in his cell, with the walls covered in photographs. Facilities: Coates's cell has a television and DVD player, and is covered in photographs . Mugshot: Coates was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2013 for attacking a man . In one of the first posts, from last October, Coates joked: 'Go out or stay in? Hmmmmmm.' In another message, he claimed he was 'glad I am locked away' so he wouldn't have to mix with other people in his home town of Macclesfield, Cheshire. A spokesman for the Prison Service said they were investigating the matter, and had asked Facebook to close the page. Coates was jailed in October 2013 alongside his friend Hayden Whittaker after he admitted helping to stab a man with a kitchen knife. He held the victim down while Whittaker knifed him, shortly after the pair had failed to get in to a block of flats where they were trying to sell drugs. Killer: Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, who was jailed for stabbing a young father, has been filmed partying behind bars, it emerged yesterday . Coates later boasted about what he had gone, sending a text message to friends in which he said 'I put the gun to his head.' The victim suffered a collapsed lung following the savage attack. A prisons spokesman said: 'Anyone caught accessing social networking sites or instructing others to do so on their behalf will be subject to strict disciplinary action. 'No prisoner should be in any doubt that if they break the rules they will be stripped of privileges and may be reported to the police for further action, which may result in extra time being added to their sentence.' It is not known which jail Coates is serving his sentence in. His photographs emerged just a day after a murderer was filmed partying to prison hooch and singing along to rap lyrics in a video shared on WhatsApp. Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, who stabbed a young father to death in 2006, clutched a glass of illegal alcohol in the clip, which also showed a large stash of party food.

{"article": "(CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: . In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \"Iran never denied it,\" Zarif tweeted back. \"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \"Mr. Ambassador\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.", "reference": "Mohammad Javad Zarif has spent more time with John Kerry than any other foreign minister .\nHe once participated in a takeover of the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco .\nThe Iranian foreign minister tweets in English .", "pred_summary": "Mohammad Javad Zarif is Iran's foreign minister and John Kerry's opposite number.\nIn September 2013, he tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah\" referring to the Jewish New Year.\nZarif left Iran in 1977, but website says he was born in 1960."}

The number of teenagers getting straight As at GCSE has soared by a third in just five years, new figures show. More than 20,000 children passed ten or more with either an A or an A* grade, Department for Education statistics reveal. But critics say increasing numbers of high-fliers mean not enough has been done to stop qualifications becoming too easy. The latest figures show that one in 30 pupils who sat the exams ended up with at least ten A grades. In 2009, the number of students who managed to get straight As was 15,791. This rose to 16,983 in 2010, 18,468 in 2011 and 18,829 in 2012. In 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, 20,307 received As across the board. The figures suggest Britain\u2019s most able students are increasingly getting top marks in all subjects. GCSE grades are used by universities to decide who to admit to courses, along with personal statements and references. However, as a greater proportion of pupils is classified as excellent, it is harder for top universities such as Oxford and Cambridge to identify truly exceptional youngsters. And while British results appear to be improving for some pupils, the country is slipping behind other nations when measured using international tests. Results published just over a year ago showed British teenagers dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time. Tests on more than half a million pupils worldwide found those in Vietnam, Shanghai and Poland had a much better command of core subjects. Children in the Chinese city of Shanghai were three years ahead of their British counterparts by 15. Overall, the UK came 26th out of 65 countries and economic regions in the report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Christopher McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: \u2018Sadly, grade inflation has devalued GCSEs to such an extent that any pass below a B has become little more than a certificate of incompetence. Critics say increasing numbers of high-fliers mean not enough has been done to stop qualifications becoming too easy. GCSE grades are used by universities to decide who to admit to courses (file picture) \u2018International comparisons of educational attainment, very serious concerns expressed by employers and the fact that many universities now have to put on remedial catch-up courses for new undergraduates, all point to a disastrous dumbing down of standards.\u2019 The Coalition tried to halt grade inflation by making qualifications more rigorous, but many reforms are still being implemented.

University student Waheed Ahmed, 21, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was held at Birmingham Airport in the early hours of this morning by anti-terrorism police. He was deported by the Turkish authorities and flown back to Britain on a plane packed with holidaymakers last night. Ahmed and eight of his relatives - including four children ranging from a one-year-old baby to an 11-year-old - were stopped on the Turkish border with Syria on April 1. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Waheed Ahmed, the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor, has been held at Birmingham Airport after returning for allegedly trying to sneak into Syria with eight members of his family (pictured in Turkey) Convoy: Ahmed was seen being moved by Turkish police on Sunday and then put on a Monarch-operated Flight from Dalaman which landed at Birmingham Airport at 12.14am today . They were arrested by Turkish police within walking distance of the border with Syria in the town of Reyhanli earlier this month. Ahmed was filmed leaving Antakya police station in the Hatay Province in southern Turkey and getting on a coach to Antalya, which is 500 miles to the west, on Sunday. And he is believed to have arrived back in the UK on Monarch-operated Flight ZB 909 from Dalaman which landed at Birmingham Airport at 12.14am today. Greater Manchester Police said they are working to ensure the safe return of the rest of the group, which included four children aged one, three, eight and 11. In a statement, the force said: 'In the early hours of Tuesday 14 April 2015, a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of Commission, Preparation or Instigation of acts of Terrorism at Birmingham Airport'.

Fellow passengers said they were held in their seats before a man thought to be Ahmed, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was whisked off the plane. One man who was on the flight said: 'We landed and taxied to the terminal and then there was an announcement over the tannoy. 'It said someone needed special assistance and we had to remain in our seats. 'Then a plain-clothed policeman got on the plane and escorted someone off. It was quite far away from me so I couldn't make out what they looked like. 'There were other police officers on the tarmac too and they got into a car and drove off. It all happened very quickly.' Other travellers said they saw a police van and car driving away from a side exit at the airport shortly after the plane landed. The student's father, Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - who has been pictured with party leader Ed Miliband - previously said he wanted his son 'to come home as soon as possible'. Mr Ahmed, who sits on Rochdale Borough Council, thought his son had been in Birmingham on a work placement when he discovered that he had been detained in Turkey. Police searched the councillor's home earlier this month for clues about why Ahmed had travelled to the country. In a statement Councillor Shakil Ahmed said: 'My son is a good Muslim and his loyalties belong to Britain, so I don't understand what he's doing there.

{"article": "A handwritten book containing notes and calculations made by Alan Turing while he worked on decoding Enigma  has been sold at auction for \u00a3700,000. The 56-page document, believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript in existence, was written in 1942 at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire. The notebook, in which he details his work on the foundations of mathematical notation and computer science, was sold for $1,025,000 (\u00a3698,000) in a Fine Books & Manuscripts Sale at Bonhams in New York on Monday. Scroll down for video . Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . A handwritten notebook in which Britain's Enigma machine genius Alan Turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $1million (\u00a3690,000). Above, he wrote that the Leibniz notation was 'extremely difficult' Turing is best known for his contribution to cracking the code used by the Germans in their Enigma machines during the Second World War while working at at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire. He is often said to be the father of modern computing and artificial intelligence. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said:\u00a0'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The 56-page book bought in Cambridge contains Turing's thoughts on the clearly tricky 'Leibniz notation dx/dy'. 'I find [it] extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one I understood the best once!' he wrote. Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' Prior to the sale, Andrew Hodges, a leading Turing scholar, said: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value. 'This notebook shines extra light on how, even when he was enmeshed in great world events, he remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' But Turing died from cyanide poisoning in 1954, generally thought to have been an act of suicide as a consequence of the hormone treatment he was undergoing as an alternative to imprisonment for his homosexuality. Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologised on behalf of the British Government in 2009 for the way Turing had been treated and he was granted a posthumous pardon in 2013. It will be sold by Bonhams in New York on Monday. It said the seller wished to remain anonymous. Part of the proceeds will be donated to charity. Cassandra Hatton, senior specialist in Fine Books and Manuscripts and the History of Science at Bonhams,\u00a0said: \"This is a wonderful result and a fitting testament to Alan Turing's impact and legacy. 'It has been a great privilege to have been involved in this sale and we are immensely pleased that all the people who bid for this unique item and indeed the wider public have recognised Turing's importance and place in history.'

Dyche, 43, has a growing reputation having overseen a remarkable transformation of fortunes since arriving at Turf Moor in October 2012. The former Chesterfield defender made a nonsense of the relegation favourites' tag to lead the Clarets to an unlikely promotion from the Championship to the top flight last season. Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . Duff has backed his manager Sean Dyche to one day take charge of the England team . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . This term they are attempting to defy the odds again and with eight games remaining they have a fighting chance of survival in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players. 'Most of our players have played the majority of their careers in the Championship or lower than that and we are competing against multi, multi-million pound squads and we are alive and kicking. 'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it. He said: 'I've done my Pro Licence and I want to stay in football after I've finished playing. 'I have no plans to stop playing at the minute. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It's not a bad job running around chasing after a football. 'But you look at the game differently when you get to my age. The Pro Licence is nearly all based on management, so you look at sessions differently, look at the manager's presentations - and this one isn't a bad manager to learn from.'

{"article": "An Italian ice cream man pursued his older rival in his van and then punched him through the driver's window in a turf war over 'stealing' customers from a new housing development. The row broke out between Andrea Trunfio, 36, and Mario Bretti, 64, after the former allegedly tried to muscle in on Mr Bretti's patch. A court heard how the pair clashed as they drove their vans away from the site on a scorching day in July last year. Mr Bretti said his competitor chased him along a busy road before cutting him off at a junction and blocking him with his van. He then got out and threw a flurry of punches at the 64-year-old through the driver's window. Pursued: Mr Bretti, 64, was chased by his younger rival Andrea Trunfio over an argument over a disputed site . The incident took place around the new Ridgeway Farm housing development on July 22 last year, when temperatures reached 25 degrees during a spell of sunny weather. Describing what happened, Mr Bretti said: 'I have been doing this for 45 years, since I was just 18 years old. On July 22, I got beaten up by another ice cream man. 'He decided to follow me on Thamesdown Drive in the middle of the road. He was going fast through the traffic lights, and when they went red I had to stop. He blocked me with his van so I couldn\u2019t get away. 'He came up to the van and punching me threatened to kill me, saying he had claimed the building site as his area. 'I was selling there because Sparcells is my area. He was very aggressive and started punching me several times and said he would come to my home. In the end I drove away to get away from him.' Mr Bretti said he felt very dizzy and frightened after the altercation and went straight to the police station, while Trunfio did a U-turn and sped off. Dispute:\u00a0Mr Bretti said he felt very dizzy and frightened after the altercation and went straight to the police . Trunfio denied common assault and claimed Mr Bretti had threatened to kill his family and burn his van if he went back to the disputed site. Speaking through an intepreter, he claimed he had seen Mr Bretti at the site that day and his older rival had beckoned him to follow afterwards. He said when they pulled up at the traffic lights, Mr Bretti grabbed his arm before rolling up the window to trap it. He also told the court had sold ice creams in Swindon for ten years and had been at the housing development for two or three months before the incident. He also claimed there had been prior arrangements which meant Mr Bretti would no longer sell at the building site. Trunfio, from Swindon, told the magistrates' court in Chippenham, Wiltshire: 'In our community, usually each person has an area. There is no law to say you can't go to certain places.

{"article": "Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons had been on my wish list for a while - and Mum is such a huge fan of Raymond Blanc she once confessed he could be her Mastermind subject\u2026 . Nestled in the green rolling hills of the Chilterns, Le Manoir is a striking building; a 15th Century manor house built with golden bricks and burgundy roof tiles, and boasting tall chimney stacks and climbing wisteria. It is beautiful - and it's impossible not to gawp. The impeccably kept grounds included perfectly trimmed lawns, bronze sculptures (including a scarecrow based on Blanc himself), pathways lined with lavender and the walled organic kitchen garden - which supplies the restaurant with seasonal herbs, salads and vegetables. Lucy Verasamy proudly shows one of the healthy and tasty dishes created at\u00a0Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons . Raymond Blanc pays a surprise visit to the cooking school that bares his name in his Oxford manor house . Our twin room for the night was huge. We loved it - from the flattering lighting and the textured wallpaper to the cashmere blankets on the end of the beds. Le Manoir's restaurant has held two Michelin stars for the best part of the 30 years since it opened. We decided to go for the full-on dining experience and the seven-course taster menu. Each dish was presented like a work of art - it almost seemed a shame to attack it with my cutlery. It was so good we were both unusually quiet. With every course came a helpful and brief explanation, and a glass of wine. The cheese trolley was one of the biggest I'd seen. By this stage I was on mouse-sized portions and ready to pop. The next morning I was woken by the sound of birds rather than the alarm on my phone. We headed down to breakfast but were distracted from the huge smorgasbord of choice by Blanc himself as he bounced around the tables, cheerfully welcoming guests. Le Manoir boasts  stunning grounds, luxury accommodation and Blanc's two Michelin-starred restaraunt . Thankfully, Mum was more starstruck than stalker when it was our turn. Chatty and friendly, Blanc noticed my Bircher muesli and immediately offered up the recipe. I had signed up to the Food, Body, Mind course due to start promptly at 9am - one of several day-long courses run at the in-house cookery school. A few minutes in, Blanc unexpectedly arrived and introduced the course - passionate, enthusiastic and energetic he spoke about the importance of nutrition and being mindful of the ingredients we choose. This was right up my street and I couldn't wait to get going. Natalia, a nutritionist, and Mark, a chef who has worked with Blanc for more than 25 years, were brilliant course hosts and teachers. With their amazing knowledge, they were like a human foodie Google. Natalia banished misleading food myths, while her informative facts and figures on the latest medical research were fascinating. I couldn't help but scribble down notes. Food icon Raymond Blanc and Lucy bond over a delicious creme caramel at his Oxfordshire cooking school . I thought my limited cooking skills would be a hindrance, but far from it. Mark showed us several easy, healthy dishes - some of which we cooked, wearing our chef whites in our own fully equipped kitchens. Hands-on Blanc popped back just as we were making our sugar-free chocolate mousse - and wasted no time in helping out with the frantic whisking. Trains run from London Marylebone to Haddenham & Thame Parkway (a 10-minute drive to the hotel and restaurant) Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons\u00a0offers a Wine & Dine break from \u00a3895 per couple. This includes a five-course dinner, three glasses of wine each and one night's B&B accommodation. The Food, Mind, Body course costs from \u00a3395pp. I loved every minute of it and learned so much - from interesting food facts (who knew fresh-out-of-the-ground new potatoes were a healthier option than blueberries?) to helpful kitchen skills. I've lost count of the times I've rustled up some of the recipes at home since. It had been a massive treat. I had asked Raymond which season was best to visit Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons.

On Facebook, the animal center said the puppies appear to have been neglected over an extended period of time due to their poor condition . 'There was no air ventilation for the puppies and they were covered in urine and suffered from heat exhaustion--the temperature in the box was estimated to be well over 100 degrees,' the center wrote. 'The box had been left at a Goodwill drop off site near HWY 58. The dogs were over heated and covered in urine from a long period of time being inside the box. 'All three dogs are being treated at McKamey Animal Center. 'It would appear they have been neglected over an extended period of time due to their poor condition.'

Murphy, player of the month for February and March, went over in the left corner on 15 minutes from Jake Connor's pass. He was then on hand when Ukuma Ta'ai, who also scored twice, caught and off-loaded a kick from Danny Brough on 37 minutes. In-form winger Aaron Murphy scored twice in a seven-try romp as Huddersfield beat Catalans Dragons . Former Wakefield Wildcats star Murphy, 27, has now scored six tries in his last five appearances. Having fallen behind Catalans hit back to lead 8-6 - with scrum-half Scott Dureau bagging all of their points. He scored a try on 21 minutes when Elliot Whitehead passed inside after a solo dash past two players split the Giants defence. Dureau converted and then added a penalty goal on 24 minutes for a poor shoulder charge on him by Joe Wardle. Wardle was restored to the Giants line-up after being suspended for last week's defeat by St Helens for a dangerous throw on Ben Cockayne. Huddersfield responded with three tries in 10 minutes at the end of the first half - and it could have been more. Connor nearly put Murphy in again down the left on 27 minutes while Leroy Cudjoe was held up on the right flank after Brough's break from deep. In between Ta'ai pounced for a try when a Dragons defender fumbled a high kick from Brough on 30 minutes. Scotland star Brough, whose kicking caused problems for the visitors all game, was at it twice more before half-time. His kick led to Murphy's second try and then another Brough bomb was dropped on the hooter by a defender and Cudjoe pounced. Brough, who took his tally to 58 points for the season with three earlier conversions, this time hit the post. Huddersfield led 22-8 at the break, with the sides trading tries after the restart as Catalans narrowed the gap to 26-14. Julian Bousquet scored a converted try on 45 minutes while Jermaine McGillvary went over at the other end eight minutes later. There was controversy on 62 minutes when a simmering feud between Cudjoe and Willie Tong boiled over. The pair seemed to exchange words and former NRL star Tong responded by appearing to headbutt Cudjoe right in front of referee Robert Hicks. Tong was sin-binned and Cudjoe got a verbal warning in the presence of Giants skipper Brough. Huddersfield took full advantage of the extra man by running in two quick tries, first from Ta'ai a minute later and then Scott Grix on 65 minutes. There was no further score, but Louis Anderson lost his temper late on as Huddersfield defensively shut the game down.", "reference": "Aaron Murphy scored twice as Huddersfield ended three-match losing run .\nFormer Wakefield Wildcats star has now scored six tries in his last five .\nMurphy\u00a0went over in the left corner on 15 minutes from Jake Connor's pass .\nHe was then on hand when Ukuma Ta'ai off-loaded kick from Danny Brough .", "pred_summary": "Aaron Murphy scores twice as Huddersfield beat Catalans Dragons 38-14.\nGiants have now won three of their last four Super League games.\nCatalans lead 8-6 until three tries from Murphy and one from Ukuma Ta'ai.\nThere is controversy after a clash between Leroy Cudjoe and Willie Tong."}

The man accused of shooting two police officers during a demonstration in Ferguson has confessed to the crime in a series of phone calls from jail that were recorded. Jeffrey Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief. All inmates are informed their phone conversations while behind bars are recorded and can be used as evidence against them, but despite the warning Williams spoke freely about the incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center. In a conversation with his girlfriend, Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD on the night of the shooting . 'Nobody aiming at no police,' Williams said. 'I ran up the hill and he (an unidentified person) shot at the car. ... I shot back,' Williams said in the recordings first obtained by KMOV-TV. In another conversation, Williams expressed concern about a possible lengthy prison sentence. 'Even though I was in the wrong, though, I should have just went the other way,' he said. 'Oh man, now I'm looking at 10 years.' Prosecutors say Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else. Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest. Despite being warned that phone calls from prison can be used as evidence, Jeffrey Williams, 20, spoke freely about the March 12 incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center . Christmas told The Associated Press on Wednesday morning he hadn't heard the audio of the phone conversations, but he stood by what Williams told him. 'My client has maintained to me that he never fired a gun that night,' Christmas said. 'So until I'm able to see evidence that I can distinctly talk to him about, I have to maintain my commitment to the statements that he has made to me.' Christmas was also critical of the justice center for releasing audio that provides potential evidence against Williams. Ferguson has been a focal point since a white police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9. A grand jury in November declined to indict the former officer, Darren Wilson, who also was cleared of civil rights violations by the U.S. Department of Justice in March. Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD and wasn't aiming at the cops. He also expressed remorse . Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest . But a separate DOJ report found widespread racial bias in Ferguson's policing efforts and the municipal court system, which it said was driven by profit mostly extracted from black and low-income residents. Several city officials were fired or resigned following the report. Among those was Police Chief Tom Jackson, and his resignation led several dozen people to protest outside of police headquarters. The demonstration was about to break up when shots rang out. A St. Louis County officer was shot in the shoulder; a Webster Groves officer was hit in the face. Both are expected to fully recover.", "reference": "Jeffrey Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on during a rally on March 12 .\nDespite warnings at the start of prison phone calls that they can be used as evidence, he spoke free about the incident to his girlfriend .\nWilliams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD and wasn't aiming at the cops.\u00a0He also expressed remorse .\n'Even though I was in the wrong, though, I should have just went the other way,' he said.

Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women .

No attention to detail was spared as huge posters were placed over the welcome billboards at the airport.

Even fictitious immigration documents and car licence plates were created to make the group think they were in Golfito, a port town in Costa Rica.

In July, she filed for a restraining order against him. 'He believes we are in a relationship,' she told the court. 'He got ahold of my cellphone # somehow and left me a message about getting together this weekend. He's unstable and delusional.' Fears: Lucia posted this letter detailing her terrifying ordeal to The Current's website on Wednesday as she explained to fans why she would be taking some time off work for a while . She was granted the restraining order, which prevented him from being within two city blocks of her Minneapolis home, but he allegedly went on to violate it on multiple occasions. 'I wake up thinking of you and repeat before bed,' he allegedly wrote in one handwritten note he sent Lucia. 'This feeling is so real to me! Just can't ignore it anymore.' He left candles, a bottle of wine, a frog calculator and flowers at her home - allegedly violating the restraining order five times between August and October 2014. 'Do you know what it's like to feel unsafe watching a band at First Avenue?' Lucia wrote online on Wednesday. 'To worry any time a stranger approaches you? To not be able to sleep or eat properly? That's what my past year has been like. 'I've made a 21-year career on the radio in this town being honest and authentic, and now I'm deathly afraid to reveal too much of myself on the air.' Scary: Lucia, pictured, said she was always looking over her shoulder or fearful when a stranger approached her because of how Kelly allegedly bombarded her with letters and emails saying they should be together . After the incessant contact, station officials alerted the St. Paul police department, which launched an investigation before turning it over to Minneapolis authorities. Kelly was charged last October with a single count of stalking for violating the court order. He could go to prison for up to 10 years as well as a $20,000 fine if he is found guilty at his trial, which starts on Tuesday. Lucia did not say how much time she will be taking off but said she plans to return 'soon'.

{"article": "Commonplace they may be, but there's nothing ordinary about camellias. Polished evergreen foliage provides a great contrast with brightly coloured flowers and brings life to dull winter gardens. And when the flowers open their '\u00adalabaster petals' \u2014 as the novelist Balzac put it \u2014 camellias are positively regal. They are easy to grow, but picky about soil. If yours is acid, free-draining and nutritious, they'll thrive, but they mope in alkaline or neutral ground. So, if your soil doesn't suit, plant in containers in ericaceous compost. The polished evergreen foliage of Camellias makes for a great contrast to the brightly coloured flowers . Camellias are amazingly versatile. You can give them free rein or prune to keep them compact. I've seen them trained on walls, bent over arches and even grown as hedging. Tender kinds such as C. reticulata make outstanding conservatory plants. Camellias are happy in sun or shade and grow as readily among other shrubs as in isolation. Though frost will damage open flowers, the buds and plants of most are bone hardy. And unlike other spring shrubs, camellias stagger their flowering over a long time. PERFECT FOR POTS . Potted camellias won't last as long as those in the ground. They tend to lose their youthful charm after five or six years, but are not difficult to propagate. If you don't want to buy new, take root cuttings and bring them on as replacements. The best time to take cuttings is between September and February, but you can try it now. Select healthy young shoots for leaf bud cuttings. Snip out sections, each with a single leaf and a little bud by the leaf stalk. Sever each stem just above that bud and again an inch below the leaf. Put the cutting in a mix of potting compost and grit or Perlite and place in a cold frame or propagator. This is also a good time to buy camellia plants. You can see them in flower, select your favourites and enjoy this year's display. The choice is vast, with 250 wild species and hundreds more garden varieties. Camellia japonica \u2014 native to cooler regions of China, Japan and Korea \u2014 has given rise to the hardiest and prettiest. I grow sumptuous red semidouble Adolphe Audusson and single white Alba Simplex, which thrive in containers in our bracing Lincolnshire climate. The Williamsii hybrids are also gorgeous. Developed in the Twenties by J. C. Williams, the former owner of Caerhays Castle in Cornwall, they have a greatly extended flowering season. I grow the first-named of his progeny, St Ewe. If the weather is mild, the single pink flowers appear in midwinter and continue until April. PINK AND PERKY . You may not have heard of St Ewe, but you're likely to know Donation, Britain's most popular Camellia variety. The semi-double, subtly veined pink flowers have a translucent alabaster gleam and it never stints on flower numbers. If your soil is borderline acid, Williamsii camellias, such as Donation, seem to do best. Each spring, work sulphur powder into the ground round the plants at 200g per square metre to boost acidity. And feed camellias \u2014 as well as other lime-haters \u2014 with chelated iron tonic. Otherwise, problems are few. Premature bud drop is caused by lack of water in summer, so keep the potting compost moist. Yellowing foliage signals a magnesium deficiency, but you can cure that with Epsom salts. Dissolve 20g per litre of water and sprinkle on the leaves and the ground around the plant. If, in mid-spring, your bush is disfigured by too many dead flowers, grab the main stems and give them an energetic shake. A storm of dead petals and debris will fly in all directions \u2014 but the buds will be unharmed and a glorious new display will be imminent.", "reference": "The Camellias evergreen foliage provides a contrast to the bright flowers .\nThey are easy to grow and like acid,\u00a0free-draining\u00a0and nutritious soil .\nCamellias are happy in sun or shade and grow readily among other shrubs .", "pred_summary": "camellias are amazingly versatile and can be grown in many ways.\nThey are easy to grow, but picky about soil.\nIf yours is acid, free-draining and nutritious, they'll thrive.\nTender kinds such as C. reticulata make outstanding conservatory plants."}
{"article": "(CNN)On May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat \"terrorism\" and \"separatism.\" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for \"terrorism,\" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety \"national emergency.\" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.", "reference": "Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide; much of it makes for grim reading .\nSalil Shetty: Countries that use executions to deal with problems are on the wrong side of history .", "pred_summary": "Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.\nDeath sentences recorded in 2014 were up more than 500 on the previous year.\nMore than 60 people have been put to death since the Peshawar attack in December."}

Police arrested 12 protesters Thursday when they tried to block trucks heading to the peak of Mauna Kea where one of the world's largest telescopes is being built. While the Native Hawaiian groups do not oppose the Thirty Meter Telescope itself, they disagree with the location of the construction on Mauna Kea - the highest point in the state which is considered a home of deities. About 300 people took part in the demonstration and those who were arrested were released after they each posted a $250 bail. Scroll down for video . Department of Land and Natural Resources officers arrest a Thirty Meter Telescope protester at the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hilo, Hawaii on Thursday . Thirty Meter Telescope protesters chant after being arrested from the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea . Native Hawaiians believe the site where the telescope is being assembled is sacred because it is where their creation story begins, said Kealoha Pisciotta, an opponent of the telescope project. And scientists believe the site is ideal location for one of the world's largest telescopes because of its remote and sheltered position, nestled in the crater of a dormant volcano. 'It is the burial grounds of some of our most sacred and revered ancestors,' said she said. 'It is a place where we go for sanctuary and release from the world around us, and it is also the home of our god.' All of the highest points in the islands are considered the home of deities, according to Pisciotta. 'I wouldn't consider it civil disobedience. We consider it civil assistance,' protestor Kahookahi Kanuha said reports Hawaii News Now.\u00a0'We were attempting to assist the authorities in upholding the law. 'And those who are being disobedient to the law are those with TMT, who are continuing to break the regulations of developing on conservational land.' After the vehicles were allowed to pass, about 40 to 50 people began following the trucks, which moved slowly because of their heavy loads. Protesters are preventing construction of a giant telescope near the summit of a mountain held sacred by Native Hawaiians. Some consider the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope project as desecrating the Big Island's Mauna Kea (on Monday protesters formed a road block outside the Mauna Kea visitors center) Department of Land and Natural Resources officers lead Thirty Meter Telescope protesters from the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea on Thursday . Work got underway after protesters were arrested and their path was cleared to the summit, Sandra Dawson, a spokeswoman for the project, said in an email to The Associated Press. Police said they warned protesters after an incident Monday that anyone who blocked the road would be arrested. On Monday, more than 50 protesters formed a roadblock Monday that stopped about 15 vehicles carrying workers up Mauna Kea, causing workers to wait more than eight hours before making their way down the mountain. 'We regret that police action had to be taken to enable our legal access to the project site,' Thirty Meter Telescope project manager Gary Sanders said in a statement relating to Thursday's arrests. Opponents who question whether land appraisals were done correctly and whether Native Hawaiian groups had been consulted have tried to prevent the construction of the telescope. A Department of Land and Natural Resources officer, center left, comforts a Thirty Meter Telescope protester on the summit . Protests also disrupted a groundbreaking and Hawaiian blessing ceremony last year, but no one was arrested. In fact, some protesters who yelled during the ceremony later apologized to event organizers and helped put away chairs, Pisciotta said. 'We said aloha to each other, and we hugged,' she said. University of Hawaii spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said in a telephone interview that the university is saddened about the arrests, but that access to site must be maintained. 'If the university had a heart, it would be broken right now,' he said about Thursday's arrests. However, 'we have to make sure the road is safe for whoever wants to be there.' The university sub-leases the land atop Mauna Kea for the telescope project, and it has always maintained that protesters would have free access to the site as long as they were not breaking any laws, he said. Meisenzahl said he was not certain why the arrests were made.

{"article": "(CNN)As ash from Chile's Calbuco Volcano spread east into Argentina, geologists warned of the potential for more activity Friday. Evacuations in the region involved not only people but animals as well. \"There is more seismic activity ... and we think there will be more activity today,\" Helmuth Huerta, a spokesman for Chile's National Geological and Mining Service, told CNN. The volcano has already erupted twice this week, spewing ash to a depth of about 23\u00bd inches (60 centimeters) in some places, according to the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety. New advisories say airborne ash could reach an altitude of 12,000 feet. Calbuco erupted twice in 24 hours, the geological agency said early Thursday. The agency said it was evaluating a spectacular nighttime eruption but indicated it was \"stronger than the first one.\" In Ensenada, houses, trees and even sheep were blanketed gray with ash, CNN's Shasta Darlington reported. People were removing salmon -- a staple of the local economy -- amid fear of contamination from ash and lava. Trucks were used to evacuate farm animals and pets. Authorities issued a red alert for the popular tourist towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in the south. People were being evacuated to Port Montt on 22 buses and military trucks, the interior ministry said. Officials said that volcanic flows from Calbuco caused rising water levels in the R\u00edo Blanco. A 12-mile (20-kilometer) exclusion zone was established around the crater. Military and police forces were helping evacuate more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said. An additional 2,000 residents of Chamiza were being evacuated as a preventive measure after river levels rose due to volcanic flows. More evacuations were expected in Lago Chapo and Correntoso. The first eruption on Wednesday set off a bit of a panic in the region. \"At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew. And later, there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,\" a Puerto Montt resident said. Another person said: \"It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs.\" Magma expanse under Yellowstone supervolcano more vast than thought . The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was 1962. There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996. Alejandro Verges, regional director of the Interior Ministry, said that officials are concerned there might be a third eruption. \"The situation is relatively calm right now, although people are understandably anxious about what could happen tonight,\" he said.", "reference": "Volcano already has erupted twice this week .\nIt has spewed ash to a depth of about 23\u00bd inches in some places, Chilean officials say .\nAuthorities issue an alert for two towns, and there's a 12-mile exclusion zone .", "pred_summary": "\"We think there will be more activity today,\" a geologists says.\nChile's Calbuco Volcano erupted twice in 24 hours.\nAuthorities issued a red alert for the popular tourist towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas."}
{"article": "The Queen\u2019s staff will take industrial action for the first time in history over their \u2018ridiculously low\u2019 wages. Wardens at Windsor Castle say they are expected to carry out extra duties, including giving guided tours to visitors, for no extra money. Union chiefs claim workers earn as little as \u00a314,700 despite working the \u2018country\u2019s richest family\u2019. Wardens at Windsor Castle (pictured here collecting flowers laid by well-wishers following the death of The Queen Mother) have voted for industrial action in a dispute over pay . Their main role includes meeting and greeting visitors, conducting security searches, telling people about the history of the Castle, and handing out free audio guides. But The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said staff are also asked to perform extra duties for free, such as leading paid-for tours, carrying out first aid and speaking foreign languages to overseas visitors. Now, staff have voted \u2018overwhelmingly\u2019 in favour of industrial action after complaining they have suffered \u2018years of pay restraint\u2019. The PCS said 76 wardens out of 180 at the Castle will now refuse to host tours of the Great Kitchen and the Tower and will instead \u2018work to rule \u2013 meaning they rigidly stick to their contractual obligations. The Public and Commercial Services Union said the Queen and Royal Family (pictured at the Castle) should not 'abuse the (workers') goodwill by not properly rewarding them' Wardens are also considering causing \u2018disruption\u2019 and \u2018long queues\u2019 by conducting more thorough security searches than usual and \u2018observing every single check they are supposed to do\u2019 \u2013 slowing down visitors\u2019 entry to the Castle. The wardens work for the Royal Collection Trust, a charity which presides over one of the world\u2019s largest and most important works of art, jewels and artefacts. It is held in trust by the sovereign on behalf of the nation, so they are technically employees of the Royal Household. A spokesman for the PCS said: \u2018The dispute here is not with the Queen and the Royal Family but the managers who run the Castle on their behalf. \u2018The wardens who work at Windsor Castle are very loyal and want to work for the Royal Family. \u2018We believe our requests are modest and reasonable and, by not resolving this dispute, the Royal Collection is dragging the Queen\u2019s name into this. That is not what staff want.\u2019 Staff claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties such as guiding visitors around Windsor Castle\u00a0for no additional money . The union has proposed that wardens receive an extra \u00a3150 a year for speaking a foreign language to visitors and an allowance for every day they conduct tours. They claimed that at nearby Hampton Court Palace, owned by a separate charity, wardens received an extra \u00a310 to \u00a315 a day for leading guided tours and that Windsor Castle staff should also receive \u2018fair recompense\u2019. The union said they narrowly accepted a poor pay offer last year on the understanding that additional allowances for tours and other skills would be considered this year. But following failed negotiations, non-strike industrial action could now start from the end of April. A Royal Collection Trust spokesman said: \u2018Following the union ballot, we have been informed that some PCS-affiliated wardens at Windsor Castle will no longer participate in various activities undertaken during their working day, including using their language and first-aid skills, and conducting tours of specific areas of the castle during August and September. A spokesman for the Royal Collection Trust, which employee the wardens at one of the official residences of the Queen said they were 'disappointed' with the result of the ballot . \u2018These activities have never been compulsory. It has always been the choice of the individual as to whether they take part. \u2018While the outcome of the ballot is disappointing, it will have no effect on services to visitors to the castle.\u2019 The Royal Collection said that only nine wardens were required to conduct tours every day out of an average of 85 wardens in work, and that the industrial action should have \u2018no impact\u2019 on visitors. Asked about the threat of slower security searches, a spokeswoman said: \u2018Security searches at Windsor Castle are rigorous and we would expect staff to carry out their usual duties.\u2019 Staff\u2019s wages were raised to the new \u2018living wage\u2019, which is above the National minimum wage, earlier this month. This increased wardens\u2019 pay from \u00a37.70 an hour (\u00a314,400 a year) to \u00a37.85 an hour (\u00a314,700). But the PCS complained that the living wage officially rose last November and that this wage hike should therefore be back-dated \u2013 a condition the Royal Collection has now agreed to.", "reference": "Members of the royal household have voted for work to rule in pay row .\nWardens claim they're asked to perform extra duty for no extra money .\nStaff complained they're being\u00a0paid far below the 'living wage' they deserve .\nRoyal Collection Trust called the vote for industrial action 'disappointing'", "pred_summary": "W wardens at Windsor Castle will take industrial action for the first time in history.\nUnion chiefs claim workers earn as little as \u00a314,700 despite working for the 'country\u2019s richest family'\nThey will now refuse to host tours of the Great Kitchen and the Tower."}

Rapiejko sped around another officer as Valencia walked through a business park, hit the man from behind with the left side of his front bumper. Valencia, who flew through this air, survived and faces more than a dozen charges for an alleged crime spree that day.

{"article": "A New York teen who lost everything in Hurricane Sandy has been accepted to seven Ivy League schools. Daria Rose, 18, immersed herself in her studies after she and her family lost everything -- including their home -- when the superstorm hit in October 2012. And after a difficult high school experience, the 18-year-old has a bright future ahead of her. The Hempstead teen has been accepted into all seven of the Ivy League schools she applied to, ABC news reports. Scroll down for video . Acceptance: New York teen Daria Rose (photographed) lost everything in Hurricane Sandy and was recently accepted to seven Ivy League schools . Dreams: The frequent moves Rose and her family underwent after the superstorm made finishing school work difficult for Rose, but she never gave up on her dream of attending an Ivy League school . 'I was like, oh my God, I just got into Harvard,' Rose told ABC 7. 'Then I checked Princeton, and I was like, oh my God I, just got into Princeton. And I checked Brown, I got in. It just kept going and going.' Rose did not apply to Columbia, according to ABC. Rose and her family lived in several hotels as well as her grandmother's house after being forced to evacuate their home in Baldwin, which was destroyed, ABC News\u00a0reports. After more than a year, the family moved into a new home in Baldwin. Although the frequent moves made finishing school work difficult, Rose said, she never gave up on her dream of attending an Ivy League school. 'I was living in these small spaces but in my head I was able to escape,' Rose said 'find myself in a literary world.' Rose wrote about her Hurricane Sandy experience in a college application essay in which she talked about the storm and how reading helped her cope. Secure: A college essay about her experience\u00a0helped Rose to secure a spot in Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Brown . Blessing: Rose's mother, Katrina Brooks (left), said that the family's experience turned out to be a blessing because the teen had something substantial to write to the schools' admissions offices . The essay helped the Sacred Heart Academy student secure a spot in Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Brown. 'After moving so much and meeting so many different people, I learned I can adapt and adjust to all these different situations and people,' Rose told ABC 7. Rose's mother, Katrina Brooks, said that the family's experience turned out to be a blessing because it provided the teen with something substantial to write to the schools' admissions offices. 'It's easy to say 'I'm just going to lay here in a ball and cry and wallow in my own self pity,'' Brooks said. 'I'd make sure she'd get up and put one foot in front of the other.'

{"article": "The grey \u2018stealth\u2019 speed traps could be outlawed regardless of which party wins the general election . Hidden cameras credited with a 25 per cent spike in speeding fines could be banned from motorways within months. The grey \u2018stealth\u2019 speed traps could be outlawed regardless of which party wins the general election, it has been suggested. New figures revealed at least 112,000 motorists were given fines or appeared in court for motorway offences last year \u2013 a quarter more than in the previous year. The increase has been put down to the introduction of \u2018smart motorways\u2019 which use the cameras, known as Hadecs, to police speed limits which are varied according to the driving conditions. This means many drivers are being given the minimum \u00a3100 fines despite driving under the national motorway speed limit of 70mph. The Conservatives are already moving to scrap the controversial cameras if an ongoing review criticises their use when it reports back in the summer. And Labour has pledged to repaint them yellow so they are easier for drivers to spot. The grey cameras are becoming an increasing threat to drivers as the number of smart motorways is due to increase four fold over the next 10 years to stretch across 800 miles. But Labour has said if it wins the election, it will issue new guidelines stipulating all motorway speed cameras are yellow and any existing grey ones will be painted. A party source told The Sunday Telegraph there was a loophole which allowed the grey cameras on major roads but not smaller roads. Most of the drivers were caught last year were caught on parts of the M25, M1, M4 and M5. Roads minister John Hayes, who ordered the Highways England review which is due to report back this summer, has said he was concerned about \u2018stealth cameras\u2019 and it was important drivers knew where they were. The use of the less noticeable cameras has led to claims that police are using stealth to catch out drivers . And a Conservative source yesterday said: \u2018We\u2019ve announced a review into this and if that review shows serious problems, we will take action to stop grey cameras.\u2019 Nearly 113,000 drivers were handed speeding penalties last year according to Freedom of Information statistics provided by 24 out of 45 police forces compared to close to 89,000 in 2013 and almost 55,000 in 2010. If caught by a speed camera, drivers face a minimum \u00a3100 fine and three points on their licence, or a court summons. Avon and Somerset police caught 23,086 motorists speeding in 2014 \u2013 a rise of 756 on the year before, and Nottinghamshire police fined 9,472 drivers - up from 3,808. And both forces have linked the rises to the use of the grey cameras. A Highways England spokesman said: \u2018It has always been up to individual police forces whether to use cameras on the motorway network to enforce the national speed limit.\u2019 As the use of smart motorways is extended from current levels of around 200 miles to 800 miles over the next ten years the number of fines is set to rise even more .", "reference": "Number of motorists to appear in court has increased by a quarter .\nThe spike has been put down to introduction of 'smart motorways'\nConservatives are already moving to scrap controversial cameras .\nLabour plans to repaint them yellow to make them easier to spot .", "pred_summary": "speed cameras credited with a 25 per cent spike in speeding fines could be banned from motorways within months.\nLabour has pledged to repaint them yellow so they are easier for drivers to spot."}
{"article": "Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has revealed he wants to bring in extra investment so the club can improve their Selhurst Park home. The Premier League side, who beat champions Manchester City 2-1 on Monday night, have been reportedly targeted for a takeover by Josh Harris - an American businessman who already owns the Philadelphia 76ers NBA team and the NHL outfit the New Jersey Devils. But Parish, who has been at Palace since he and his consortium saved the club from the brink of financial collapse in 2010, has since insisted he would remain involved and that investment rather than a complete takeover was his preferred option. Jason Puncheon scored a second-half free kick as Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 2-1 on Monday . Palace chairman Steve Parish says Alan Pardew will have funds to improve the squad in the summer . And now he has given his reasons for why he believes extra funds are required, insisting the current set-up would allow manager Alan Pardew to bring in the desired summer transfer targets but that other areas require more investment. 'The only reason for us to get money in is to improve the infrastructure,' he told BBC London. 'There is no rush and we are in a good place. If it happens, it happens. We've done well enough that I think we can fund the player things we need to do out of our own resources. 'We are long overdue some ground improvements. They are very costly. We need to make sure we get that done. If that means bringing in other people, and they are the right people, then we'll do it.' Parish would, however, like investment in the club to carry out improvements at Selhurst Park . The CPFC2010 consortium took over with the Eagles having only just survived relegation from the Championship and, in under five years, have overseen a return to top-flight football. They finished last season in 11th place, ensuring for the first time that their stay in the Premier League would last longer than a solitary campaign. Pardew has guided them to the same position after being appointed at the turn of the year and Monday night's victory over City all-but guarantees a third Premier League season. Glenn Murray and Jason Puncheon had put Palace two goals up against the visitors, who could only find a consolation goal through Yaya Toure. Puncheon applauds the Manchester City supporters after a missile was thrown from the stands . Puncheon was also the target of a number of items thrown onto the pitch from the area housing Man City's supporters as he prepared to take a second-half corner. The Football Association are aware of the incident and will take appropriate action once they have their findings. It is not the first case of items being thrown onto the pitch at Selhurst Park this season, with Newcastle defender Fabricio Coloccini struck by a coin thrown as he celebrated a goal for his side. Just days later another item was thrown onto the playing area in the FA Cup meeting with Liverpool and Palace threatened to ban for life anyone found guilty of such acts.", "reference": "Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 2-1 at Selhurst Park on Monday night .\nWin all but secured Palace's status in the Premier League for another year .\nChairman Steve Parish says the club have funds to improve the squad .\nBut he wants investment to carry out necessary stadium improvements .\nCLICK HERE for the latest Crystal Palace news .", "pred_summary": "Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish wants to bring in extra investment to improve their Selhurst Park home.\nEagles have been reportedly targeted for a takeover by American businessman Josh Harris.\nBut Parish has since insisted he will remain involved and that investment rather than a complete takeover is his preferred option.\nHe insists the current set-up would allow manager Alan Pardew to get the players he wants in the summer."}

The dark-haired child, dressed in combat gear, raced back to safety after launching a series of missiles at around six heavily armed officers . The boy's stone attack came as violence erupted  on the northern West Bank during annual demonstrations to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd after more than 100 Palestinians rallied near Israel's separation barrier in the village of Bilin, with some throwing stones.

The latest figure shows salaries account for 59.9 per cent of turnover compared with 71.7 per cent for the same 20 clubs a year before.

Apart from those clubs who were promoted from the Championship last season, only Manchester City, Aston Villa and Sunderland ended the 2013/14 season having made a financial loss. Premier League director of communications Dan Johnson said the clubs' decision two years ago to introduce spending controls had also contributed to a positive financial outlook . Johnson said: 'There are two reasons for this. The first is increasing revenues and the second is the financial criteria the clubs have voted in two seasons ago which put financial sustainability at the heart of how they want to go forward.'

{"article": "Billy Joe Saunders and Chris Eubank Jnr could rematch in under six weeks after the pair reignited their war of words at a London press conference on Thursday. The pair clashed in a memorable 12-round grudge match on November 29 with British, Commonwealth and European middleweight champions Saunders handing his rival his first career defeat. Now the duo are both set to fight at Wembley Arena on May 9 but not against each other. As it stands, Eubank will be making the first defence of his WBA interim belt while Saunders will have a warm-up 'international contest' ahead of his challenge for the WBO middleweight title mooted for July. Billy Joe Saunders and Chris Eubank Jnr were involved in a war of words during the press conference . Saunders shows his unbeaten record to Chris Eubank Jnr during a press conference . Eubank challenged Saunders to take a re-match with him on May 9 . Hall of Fame promoter Frank Warren initially played down the chances of the pair fighting in May, but later said he would work on trying to get the fight on . But this show has been scheduled in a bid to build up a rematch between them, with promoter Frank Warren suggesting an autumn rematch. However they kicked off their verbal sparring in a fiery press conference and Eubank challenged Saunders to go straight ahead and fight him on May 9. And, despite having a guaranteed world title shot lined up against the winner of next week's New York clash between Andy Lee v Peter Quillin, Saunders took the bait. Saunders said: 'You want to fight on May 9? I'll tell you what we'll do, Frank can double my purse for the world title and I will fight Chris no problem. It will be on my terms because I've got the win. I'm the champion.' Eubank and Saunders have had a long standing rivalry and Saunders won when the pair met in November . Warren, who was sat between them, was startled by the agreement and initially laughed it off. But afterwards the Hall of Fame promoter revealed he will now attempt to drive through a shock deal for an early rematch. However he does have concerns about staging the fight at Wembley Arena and may seek to make the fight at a bigger venue \u2013 possibly even a football stadium if they are able to push the date back into the closed season. Warren said: 'Listen, if I could get that on for May 9, that would be on, I can assure you but we are limited by the fact it is Wembley Arena. Saunders is due to fight at Wembley arena on May 9 on the same card as Eubank Jnr . Saunders is keen to get back in the ring with Saunders and get revenge for his professional defeat . 'But when I leave this press conference you know what I will be working on and we will see how we go with it. 'I want to see it again. It was an exciting fight and there is a genuine rivalry with them, it's not done for show. 'I think the next one will be electric.' The current plan for the 25-year-old pair to meet in the autumn is a risky one as six months is a very long time in boxing. Although unlikely, either man could lose on May 9 before Saunders will face undoubtedly the biggest challenge of his career against the winner of Lee-Quillin. Saunders got the better of Eubank over 12 rounds when the pair met back in November . Eubank and Saunders are both keen on a re-match and while May 9 is a possibility an autumn fight is more realistic . Defeat for Saunders or Eubank before the rematch could damage the credibility of the fight and Warren knows it could be in everybody's best interest to get the fight on as quickly as possible. He added: 'It is a long road to the rematch and that is why when I leave here I will be sharpening my pencil and having a look at [doing the deal]. Billy has said what he wants and now we will see where we get to.' Eubank won the WBA interim world title by out-pointing Dmitry Chudinov at the 02 Arena in February and the Brighton man has urged Saunders to forget about his current route to the WBO title and instead concentrate on dethroning him. But Saunders taunted his rival by saying the belt does not mean anything. Saunders said: 'That's not a world title. Do you call that a world title yeah? Well you're mad then. You're deluded man, you must be on drugs. 'Take your little belt home and hold your trousers up with it because that is all it's good for. You haven't got any good belts, I've got the best belts.

Ahead of the trip to the Kassam Stadium, Wasps' hunt for an automatic European Rugby Champions Cup spot next season had stuttered after winning just one of their previous five fixtures in all competitions. However, they claimed a 40-13 win over Welsh with tries from Varndell, Ashley Johnson, Sailosi Tagicakibau and Alapati Leiua . Tom Varndell crosses for one of his three tries as Wasps ran out comfortable winners at the Kassam Stadium . It was far from plain sailing for Wasps, though as the Exiles, whose defeat to Bath last time out confirmed that they will finish bottom of the table, trailed 12-5 at half-time after Opeti Fonua bundled over after the first two of Varndell's tries. But Johnson dotted down and Varndell added his third before Tagicakibau secured the bonus point for Wasps, with Alapati Leiua getting in on the act with the last play of the game. Chris Elder scored Welsh's second try of the match in the second period. Wasps got off to a fast start at the Kassam as they went 12 points clear after as many minutes. The visitors found the tryline after only four minutes as Varndell broke down the right flank and scored in the corner, veteran fly-half Andy Goode converting well from a tight angle. Welsh then went down to 14 men eight minutes later when Koree Britton was sent to the sin bin for pulling down a maul and Wasps instantly capitalised as Varndell grabbed his second try. Seb Stegmann is tackled by Carlo Festuccia as the exiles put up a fight, but faded away again . Alapati Leiua breaks away to score a late try as Wasps pulled away in the closing stages . The Exiles crept back into the game, though, keeping the pressure on Wasps' defence and Fonua forced his way through to make it 12-5, Tristan Roberts kicking the conversion side. Welsh started the second half well and Roberts made amends for his earlier miss as he calmly kicked a penalty between the posts to reduce the arrears even further. But Wasps soon began to dominate and a lineout close to the try-line was bundled over by Johnson in his first start as hooker. Then a swift break down the right saw Varndell free to run back around the Welsh defence and score under the posts for his hat-trick. Elder scored a try out of nowhere four minutes later for the Exiles on his Aviva Premiership debut, as he found space on the left wing to touch down in the corner. Wasps instantly replied though as Tagicakibau finished a great run through the centre by reaching for the line.

{"article": "Two 'unemployed rich kids' have caused outrage in China after causing a major traffic accident in central Beijing by racing and wrecking an underpass and two luxurious supercars. The spectacular crash on Saturday wrote a green Lamborghini off and wrecked a red Ferrari. Both drivers have now been charged by the local Public Security Bureau with dangerous driving and have been detained, according to the\u00a0People's Daily Online. The green Lamborghini and red Ferrari - which are worth a combined total of \u00a31.3million - are believed to have been racing through the underpass in Beijing when the drivers lost control and crashed . The green Lamborghini was completely wrecked during the crash and the front end was completely severed . Neither driver was hurt but a female passenger in the Lamborghini was taken to the local hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Although both of the drivers claimed the accident was caused by the slippery road conditions at the entrance of the tunnel, the state of the crash scene led Chinese internet users to speculate that the pair had been 'drag racing', which is illegal in China. The crash occurred two hours before 'Fast and Furious 7' broke the record for midnight screenings on its launch in China, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The 20-year-old driver of the Ferrari, Yu, from Changchun City in Jilin, and the 20-year-old driver of the green Lamborghini, Tang, a native of Beijing, are both reported to be unemployed - which fuelled more backlash from people online considering the two cars are worth\u00a0in excess of 12 million yuan \u00a0- or \u00a31.3 million. 'GuoPang' from Guangxi said 'Why didn't the drivers die? No Justice!' another 'Bluesky1963' from Hunan said simply 'The spoilt rich.' and 'dajianye' from Beijing said 'That part of the road has daily car races and the sound is deafening. This is definitely the result of car racing.' 'Socialism is so good that it allows unemployed people to drive supercars,' one posting said on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, mocking the country's authoritarian system of Communist rule. 'What are their names? Who are their fathers?' one netizen asked.\u00a0'Were they in a hurry to watch Fast and Furious 7?' said another. Both cars\u00a0caused extensive damage to the guard rail and a 10 metre section of the tunnel wall (pictured) The maximum speed inside the tunnel is 60km an hour. Eyewitnesses said that halfway through the 1.2km tunnel the speeding Lamborghini swerved suddenly and lost control. The Ferrari also lost control not long after and both cars caused extensive damage to the guard rail and a 10 metre section of the tunnel wall. The cost of the damage is expected to be recouped from the drivers. The People's Daily reports that the wreckage of the Lamborghini was around 100 metres from the Ferrari and that there were no brake marks visible on the road. Debris from the cars and damaged wall were scattered across the area and closed off a section of the tunnel. The drivers were not hurt but a passenger in the Lamborghini was taken to hospital with non-serious injuries . The crash is believed to have cost thousands of pounds worth of damage to the underpass . Local residents told reporters that the tunnel is a frequent spot for car racing especially between 11pm to 12pm - creating incredibly high noise levels which disturb local residents. Residents in the nearby Fengling Lvzhou estate said they have been complaining about illegal racing in the area for years. Representatives of the residents told People's Daily Online they hear engines rumbling every week and most races take place after midnight. This has not only disturbed their sleep but also brought serious danger to the road. Residents have appealed for more speed bumps in the tunnel to prevent racing from happening. A high-speed Ferrari crash in the capital in March 2012 killed the son of Ling Jihua, a close ally of then-president Hu Jintao. Two women passengers, one of them naked, were both injured. The incident added to public perceptions in China of corrupt and high-living officials, and Ling has since been investigated for graft and dismissed from his post.

{"article": "A church will hold its Maundy Thursday service today instead of tomorrow to allow a weekly drop-in session for prostitutes to go ahead. All Saints Church in Wolverhampton re-scheduled the service, which marks the start of Easter celebrations, so that vulnerable women can attend their regular Thursday sessions tomorrow. The decision comes after prostitutes were left disappointed when the drop-in sessions were cancelled on Christmas Day and New Year's Day because they both fell on a Thursday. Outreach: All Saints Church in Wolverhampton, pictured, re-scheduled the service, which marks the start of Easter celebrations, so that vulnerable women can attend their regular Thursday sessions tomorrow . Religious leaders have praised the initiative, which has been running since last August, as reflecting the core values of Christianity. All Saints Church, which is in the middle of Wolverhampton's red light district, is the only place where prostitutes can receive the support offered by the sessions, Reverend Sarah Schofield said. The programme is run alongside national charities Changing Lives and the Terrence Higgins Trust. Service: All Saints Church is the only place where prostitutes can receive the support offered by the sessions, Reverend Sarah Schofield, pictured, said . Reverend Schofield, team vicar at All Saints Church, said: 'We throw open our doors and offer support as well as going out on the streets with hot drinks to invite women in. 'We want to be a reliable, safe and loving place for women, it is important to honour our promise and it has had a real impact on the whole church here. 'There is conversation, there is advice if any woman wants advice about employment or health or other issues. 'It is well received and it is appreciated. Christmas and New Year were on Thursday and we know we had disappointed people by cancelling the session for services. 'We had to take a vote in the congregation in January and it was 100 per cent in favour of moving the service. 'The story of Maundy Thursday is Jesus meeting with a number of people and he meets with women who are outcasts. 'One of the stories we tell on Maundy Thursday is about Jesus being anointed by a woman of low status and it felt wrong to cancel it.' The Bishop of Wolverhampton, Reverend Clive Gregory, said the decision to move the religious event forward was made by the church council and people should go elsewhere for a traditional Thursday service. He said: 'This decision wasn't taken lightly and there are other churches very close by where people can go to worship. It doesn't come across as strange to me that All Saints would do this. 'I am very well aware of this project for street workers, it has been a great success in the last six months. 'It performs a very important service for vulnerable women and is exactly what Christian churches should be doing to help their community.' Reverend Graham Smith of The Good Shepherd Church in Low Hill, added: 'It is a long-standing tradition to have a Maundy Thursday ceremony and an important part of the Christian calendar. 'On the other hand, if we remember what Jesus was all about, he would always remember the outcasts in society. 'For some of these drop-in sessions it can be quite hard to let people know what is going on if there is a change. 'So if people turn up to see it isn't on one week, they may not come again.' Custom: The Queen hands out Maundy money during last year's Maundy Thursday service in Blackburn . Maundy Thursday, also known as Easter Thursday, is the beginning of the three-day celebration of Easter. The original version of the Maundy Service involved the sovereign giving money to the poor and washing their feet, a tradition which ended with James II in the 18th century. The custom of washing feet is an an ancient one and commemorates the last supper of Jesus with the Apostles, echoing the story of Christ washing the extremities of his disciples shortly before his death. Although foot washing is no longer part of the ceremony, the tradition of giving 'alms' continues, albeit symbolically. The Maundy gift, which the Queen hands to members of the congregation at a church service, is made up of two purses, one red and one white. Many Christians commemorate the Last Supper in a special Eucharist. In some churches, they may wash each other's feet. Some Christians may hold an all night vigil in church, remembering Christ's time in the Garden of Gethsemane.", "reference": "All Saints Church, Wolverhampton, hosts Thursday session for prostitutes .\nMoved traditional Maundy Thursday service to today to avoid cancelling .\nReligious leaders said the move reflected the true values of Christianity .", "pred_summary": "All Saints Church in Wolverhampton re-scheduled service so that vulnerable women can attend their regular Thursday sessions.\nProstitution drop-in sessions were cancelled on Christmas Day and New Year's Day because they both fell on a Thursday."}

{"article": "Harlequins director of rugby Conor O\u2019Shea believes it is only a matter of time before Marland Yarde  is restored to the England fold. Yarde excelled in Saturday's roller-coaster Aviva Premiership victory over Gloucester, scoring the crucial try in the 70th minute at The Stoop. The 22-year-old wing won the last of his seven caps as a replacement last autumn, but was overlooked by England throughout the RBS 6 Nations. Harlequins winger Charlie Walker crosses for his side's first try at the Stoop . \u2018We\u2019ve had a difficult year, but anyone who has watched him will know he\u2019s been absolutely outstanding. When we get back to winning he will get recognition again,\u2019 O'Shea said. Quins spent most of an uninspiring mid-table clash feeding off scraps due to the overwhelming superiority of the visiting scrum, only to produce the key drive in the 70th minute that was finished by Marland Yarde. As half time drew close, referee Luke Pearce had finally lost patience with Harlequins set-piece frailty and pointed the finger at Joe Marler by sending the club captain to the sin-bin. Gloucester only entered the interval 13-11 ahead - a poor return given their ascendency - and then moved 18-11 clear through a Charlie Sharples try with half an hour remaining to suggest their eighth win of the season was imminent. Quins centre Aseli Tikoirotuma puts in a strong fend on Gloucester lock\u00a0James Hudson . The kicking of Nick Evans kept Quins in touch - the Kiwi fly-half finished with 14 points - before an eventful final quarter produced a flurry of yellow cards and three tries. Yarde seized the initiative for the London club and full-back Ollie Lindsay-Hague appeared to have sealed the victory, only for Dan Robson's try with a minute left to give Gloucester a faint glimmer of hope until they aimlessly kicked the ball away in the last act of the game. The opening 10 minutes were dominated by Gloucester's scrum, yet it was Quins who opened the scoring when outside centre Asaeli Tikoirotuma jinked into space before sending Charlie Walker over. Walker's try was the result of a clinical counter attack, but the 2012 Premiership champions were immediately back under pressure once play resumed with their set-piece targeted once more, conceding a penalty that Greig Laidlaw sent between the uprights. Gloucester No 8 Gareth Evans is hit hard by Quins flanker Jack Clifford . Laidlaw and Evans exchanged penalties and just as Quins began to attack with greater frequency, yet another retreating scrum gave Gloucester the platform to race into a 31st minute lead. Hook broke the gainline with a large dummy - his second of the afternoon - and found Bill Meakes in support, with the outside centre showing strength to force his way over from 10 yards out. Gloucester's set-piece dominance was rewarded when Pearce sent Marler to the sin bin, but they were unable to turn a push late in the first half into points. A big step and outside-break from full-back Lindsay-Hague created a half-chance for Yarde moments after the interval, but the England wing was well tackled. Harry Sloan tries to evade the clutches of Cherry and Whites flanker\u00a0Sione Kalamafoni . It was then Gloucester's turn to find space through Jonny May down the right wing only for Sharples to drop what should have been a try scoring pass. Two attacking scrums later, however, and Sharples dived over after Meakes had spotted the overlap caused by Quins being sucked into the one-sided forward exchanges. Evans' boot whittled down the deficit to one point but as the match entered the final quarter number eight Jack Clifford was shown a yellow card for a shoulder challenge on Sharples and Laidlaw rifled over the ensuing penalty. Gloucester scrum half\u00a0Dan Robson crosses the Quins whitewash for a late score . Despite being a man down, Quins almost scored with two successive rolling mauls and on both occasions Gloucester saw a player sin-binned - replacement lock Ross Moriarty for bringing down the first drive and Sharples for a deliberate knock on. On the third line-out catch and drive they succeeded, with Yarde touching down as the game entered the final 10 minutes. Lindsay-Hague and replacement scrum-half Robson then swapped late tries to bring the game to a dramatic if scrappy conclusion.", "reference": "Gloucester led 13-11 at half-time thanks to a Billy Meakes try .\nA Charlie Walker try and two Nick Evans penalties kept Quins in the hunt .\nCharlie Sharples register another try for the Cheery and Whites .\nBut two more Evans three-pointers kept the home side in front .\nLate tries from Marland Yarde and Ollie Lindsay-Hague secured the win .", "pred_summary": "Harlequins beat Gloucester 18-11 in Aviva Premiership clash at The Stoop.\nMarland Yarde scores crucial try in 70th minute of victory.\nThe 22-year-old wing won the last of his seven caps as a replacement last autumn.\nHe was overlooked for England throughout the RBS 6 Nations."}
{"article": "It was a moment that gave Philippe Coutinho \u2018the creeps\u2019 - standing in the players\u2019 lounge, awaiting the arrival of football royalty, he had nerves like never before. Not much flusters Coutinho, whom The Kop has christened O Magico (The Magician), but before Liverpool\u2019s tussle with Manchester United last month he and Lucas Leiva were given the chance to meet Brazil\u2019s most famous son. Spending time with Pele did not disappoint. \u2018It\u2019s the ultimate honour because Pele is the greatest player of Brazil and probably the world,\u2019 says Coutinho. \u2018We only spoke for a little bit but he asked us how things were. Yes, I got a photograph. I\u2019m going to keep it alongside the one I have with Ronaldinho.\u2019 Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho (left) described it as the 'ultimate honour' to speak to Brazil icon Pele . Pele (centre) was a special guest for the Reds' league encounter vs rivals Manchester United last month . In terms of looking for sources of inspiration, Coutinho could hardly choose two better. His ambition is to follow in their footsteps and make Brazil\u2019s fabled No 10 shirt his own but, before then, his first task must be to dominate Anfield\u2019s landscape. There is no doubting Coutinho\u2019s class. Look on YouTube and you will find footage of him bamboozling opponents as a 10-year-old in Rio de Janeiro. A decade on and the same tricks and shimmies are flummoxing defenders in the Barclays Premier League. During Monday\u2019s 2-0 dismissal of Newcastle United, Coutinho produced one moment of skill - a step-over and dummied pass all in the same movement - that prompted Brendan Rodgers to applaud. \u2018When you see the manager trusts you and gives you a lot of confidence it makes you play even better,\u2019 says Coutinho. Since the turn of the year, Coutinho\u2019s form and confidence have risen dramatically. There have been a number of spectacular moments, particularly in the FA Cup - his goals in replays against Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers are the reason Liverpool travel to Wembley to face Aston Villa in the semi-final on Sunday. Rodgers feels the resurgence of Coutinho, who is on the six-man shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year, comes from him feeling settled after signing a new long-term contract at the beginning of February. The 22-year-old does not disagree with his manager. Unlike the situation surrounding Raheem Sterling\u2019s negotiations, the discussions for Coutinho were straightforward. \u2018Liverpool have always shown a great warmth to me so when they came to me with a proposal I did not need to think twice,\u2019 he says. Coutinho (centre) scored the only goal as Liverpool won 1-0 at Blackburn in their FA Cup sixth round replay . \u2018I have always been looked after very well by this club and I am very happy here, so I didn\u2019t even have to think about it. My mind is at Liverpool.\u2019 And so on to Wembley. Again Coutinho expects to feel \u2018the creeps\u2019 at one of the sport\u2019s most iconic venues but he is also aware of how imperative it is to deliver. He says: \u2018We will try to finish the season on a high but games like this are always tough. We have to start well, do our best to play our game. It would be important to win the cup, not only for me, but for the club. That would be a massive achievement.\u2019 Coutinho's (right) displays have seen him nominated for the PFA Player and Young Player of the Year awards .", "reference": "Liverpool face Aston Villa in their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday .\nPele was a special guest as the Reds played Manchester United in March .\nPhilippe Coutinho has been nominated for the\u00a0PFA Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year awards .", "pred_summary": "Philippe Coutinho says he has the 'ultimate honour' to speak to Brazil icon Pele.\nThe 22-year-old is on the six-man shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year.\nLiverpool face Aston Villa at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday."}

Sportsmail\u00a0revealed earlier this week that the Barclays Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season. But Toure will fight for his City career this summer despite the club pondering his future. Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make him available this summer . Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the  Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian . He is said to be content with life at the Etihad Stadium despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave. The Ivorian has played a major role during City's recent trophy-laden period, helping the club to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and League Cup since joining from Barcelona in 2010. And the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for City in the future and remains fully committed to the cause. Another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four-time African Player of the Year winner's wages. Inter Milan, managed by Roberto Mancini, are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts . Toure has more than two years left on his current \u00a3220,000-a-week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less. A number of clubs, such as Inter Milan, are interested in the 31-year-old, but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it. Inter are prepared to offer Toure a five-year deal to compensate for the pay-cut he would be required to take if he moved to Italy \u2014 although, it remains to be seen whether he'd agree to such a compromise. There have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for Toure at City \u2014 which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots. But it seems the club are now happy for him to leave. City, meanwhile, will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a \u00a324million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao, currently on loan at Manchester United. City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a \u00a324million deal for Alvaro Negredo this summer . Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the Mestalla. Reports in Spain  suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a \u00a320.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday\u2019s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer but reports in Spain say they are looking at Radamel Falcao . Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has, however, not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao, who is set to leave United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao\u2019s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim and offloading Negredo is seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. City had scouts at Porto, watching their 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team\u2019s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

The medical recruitment consultant, who has always had a keen interest in politics, said hearing Mr Farage's voice makes him 'physically sick'. Scroll down for video . Richard Howarth says he breaks out in a sweat and starts shaking when he sees Ukip leader Nigel Farage . He claims the lead up to the election is a difficult time for him because Mr Farage, who is standing as a candidate in Thanet South and has appeared on TV debates, is on television so often. He said: 'It's almost like an allergy. The symptoms are similar. When I see him on telly, I sweat a lot and become anxious. 'Thinking about how the party can affect the way my son is going to be able to live his life in the UK makes me worry. 'I end up switching over because he just infuriates me. I'm obviously allergic to Nigel Farage.' Mr Howarth said he initially watched coverage of Mr Farage to educate himself on Ukip's policies. 'At the start, I did listen to his points but in the end I couldn't,' he said. 'It was not good for my health. 'Seeing him made me weak \u2013 I had to lie down. I can't watch him anymore.

A phobia expert says it's possible to have a reaction to a politician or person you fundamentally disagree with . Changing the channel usually provides instant relief, but sometimes Mr Howarth gets so frustrated thinking about Mr Farage that it takes him hours to calm down. 'If I do something else and distract myself away from it, I'm fine but otherwise it can be a couple of hours,' he said. Mr Howarth's wife Catherine, 32, has also told of his reaction. 'He has to turn the TV off or change channels because both seeing and hearing Nigel's voice makes him physically sick,' she admitted, saying she had sympathy for her husband's unusual symptoms. 'He gets anxious and irritable and his hands shake. When he does turn over his symptoms continue for a while.' Psychologist Dr Rick Norris, author of Think Yourself Happy, said Mr Howarth's reactions sound more like they are the result of a phobia rather than allergy. Mr Howarth's wife\u00a0Catherine (right) says her husband gets so wound up by Mr Farage that he starts to shake .

{"article": "(CNN)I've been a chef in some form or another since I was 14 years old, but I didn't become a food activist until much later. It was 2007, and a young girl my wife mentored was found rooting through the trash just to find something to eat. That inspired me to found Food Policy Action and become politically active in a range of food issues, from hunger to factory farms. Of course, I haven't been alone in this work. One of the biggest catalysts has been \"The Meatrix,\" a 2003 animation parody based on \"The Matrix\" and produced by the GRACE Communications Foundation, which crystallized the public health risks and environmental harms of factory farming. Recently, \"The Meatrix: Relaunched\" came out. Much more than a comical redux, it's an important benchmark in the evolution of the sustainable food movement and compels us to look back at how far we've come over the last decade -- and how far we still have to go. A decade ago, concepts like \"sustainable farming,\" \"animal welfare\" and \"organic food\" were considered fringe. While some consumers were beginning to take interest in where their meat and produce came from, public knowledge of sustainable food was limited. The standard gut-wrenching images of animal cruelty and sickly calves were ineffectual and mostly turned people off instead of urging them to make better food choices. Meanwhile, factory farms continued to reap large profits while producing subpar meat, polluting air and water resources, and damaging the public's health. To be sure, America's food system is complex, and some may argue that industrial farming has been a necessity to meet our country's food needs. However, the quality of our food has been sacrificed at this supposed altar of necessity, as industrial farms reap enormous profits that they direct toward lobbying rather than improving the quality of food they produce. In 2014 alone, the biggest meatpackers and their trade groups spent a combined $4.3 million on lobbyists. And it has paid off for them: Factory farms often avoid penalties for the damage they cause to the environment and public health; and they receive ridiculous subsidies from the U.S. government that totaled $58.7 million in 2012, according to the Environmental Working Group. These factors drive down the cost of industrially sourced meat at a rate that smaller farms can't keep up with. And since the actual costs of industrially raised meat are hidden, humanely raised meat appears expensive by comparison. That's neither fair nor safe. We all deserve to know where the food we eat comes from and that it is wholesome, and we need our elected officials to take a stand against big agri-businesses to quit letting them profit off of meat and produce that jeopardize the health of the environment and the public. It's time that consumer demand for sustainable and humane food trumps the power that industrial farms hold over our elected officials. The original \"Meatrix\" cartoon used pop culture references and family-friendly cartoons to educate consumers about the dangers of factory farming, compel them to make better food choices and spark a wave of online advocacy for better government oversight of big agriculture and meat companies. As a result, it became one of the first viral videos ever to effectively expose consumers to the realities happening behind the doors of industrial farms and the damage these facilities were doing to the environment, our public health and surrounding communities. The rise in consumer knowledge has led to an increased demand for sustainably sourced food that is healthier and tastes better. GRACE has relaunched the Eat Well Guide, an online directory of 25,000 sustainable farms, restaurants, food co-ops and farmers' markets that allows consumers to make better choices about the food they eat and provide for their families. And we at Food Policy Action have produced a legislative scorecard. We need to ask members of Congress to promote sustainable farming, not factory farms. We need them to support sensible food policies that ensure that everyone has access to food and water. Congress should vote against the DARK Act, which would block any federal or state action that required labels for foods made with genetically engineered ingredients even at the expense of the environment, public health and local economies. As more consumers are educated, they have the power to take action and call on elected officials to support sustainable farmers, not factory farms. Together, we can create a sustainable food system in America that is better for our environment and our health.", "reference": "Tom Colicchio: \"The Meatrix: Relaunched\" is an important benchmark of the evolution of sustainable food movement .\nBut factory farms continued to reap large profits while producing subpar meat, polluting nature and damaging our health .\nColicchio: We need to ask members of Congress to promote sustainable farming .", "pred_summary": "Timothy Stanley: I became a food activist after a young girl found food in the trash.\nHe says factory farms produce subpar meat while polluting air and water.\nStanley: We need to ask members of Congress to promote sustainable farming, not factory farms."}

The revelation will raise fresh questions for David Cameron over his links to millionaire donors. Multi-millionaire Richard Harpin has given the Tories \u00a3375,000 since 2008 \u2013 including \u00a350,000 in the first week of the election campaign . Mr Harpin is the chief executive of HomeServe \u2013 the maintenance firm which styles itself as the UK's 'fifth emergency service'. But the firm was handed a record \u00a330million fine last year for selling families expensive home insurance cover using misleading information and hard sell tactics. The fine came on top of some \u00a340million it is paying in refunds to thousands of wronged customers who took out the policies. Industry regulator the Financial Conduct Authority found customers were misled or bullied into taking out policies they did not need or did not cover all the problems claimed. The company \u2013 which claims it offers peace of mind to consumers who are worried about losing their boiler or water supply in the dead of winter \u2013 has three million customers in the UK, holding 7.5million policies. Tory donor Mr Harpin founded the company in 1993. The firm today employs over 2,500 people in the UK and nearly 4,000 globally and is the biggest employer in Walsall. HomeServe said the investigation was closed over a year ago, in February 2014, and related to mis-selling in the period prior to October 2011. A spokesperson said: 'Richard Harpin has been a supporter of the Conservative party for a number of years and his political donations are made in a personal capacity.' But Labour said the donation showed the Tories were out to support their wealthy friends. Jon Ashworth, Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: 'We all know that the Tories put the interests of their big money donors before those of hardworking families.' The Tories under David Cameron have \u00a0accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from a businessman whose company duped thousands of families in a mis-selling scandal . A Tory spokesman said: 'All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with Electoral Commission rules. 'Any suggestion of impropriety by the party is malicious and defamatory and will be treated as such.' The revelation comes just two days after the Tories were forced to return a donation of \u00a350,000 from a wealthy hotelier who the American authorities once wanted to extradite to face tax fraud charges. Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of \u00a320,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers. But it emerged that she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge. However on the same day in 2008 her husband Stanley Tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion. Mr Tollman repaid more than 100 million US dollars to America after the couple spent five years fighting off attempts to extradite Mrs Tollman from the UK over claims the South African couple had millions stashed in the Channel Islands. The Tollman's son, Brett, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2003 and was sentenced to more than two years in prison, as well as a $3.5 million penalty. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We were not aware of this issue but in light of these findings we will be returning donations from the Tollmans.

The elderly couple were ambushed outside their room by a passenger who had earlier sat with them in the restaurant and claims that he was snubbed, a court heard yesterday. Graeme Finlay, 53, says he was \u2018ignored\u2019 when he joined their table and so moved to another after looking at the menu. He claims Mr Phillips, 70, later struck him with his crutch during a confrontation but the couple say they were ambushed. Mr Phillips and his 69-year-old wife were on a 14-night holiday based in the Canary Islands, which involved seven nights on the Thomson Celebration ship and seven nights in a hotel. Describing the horrific night in January last year \u2013 when the liner was cruising off the coast of Lanzarote \u2013 Mr Phillips told the court he had drunk about three gin and tonics when he and his wife headed back to their cabin. Mr Phillips walked with a crutch because of a hip replacement operation and his wife also suffered from limited mobility due to osteoarthritis. He told Teesside Crown Court that he was holding both cups of hot chocolate in one hand and his crutch in the other when they were set upon as they entered their room. Mr Phillips said he was about to follow his wife into the cabin when he spotted someone out of the corner of his eye. The couple were travelling on a Thomson Celebration cruise ship when they were viciously attacked. The liner was cruising off the coast of Lanzarote when it is alleged Graeme Finlay beat the frail, elderly pair . \u2018The next thing I knew I came to with people all around me,\u2019 he said. \u2018There seemed to be blood everywhere and broken hot chocolate mugs. I only remember one punch to my head and I was knocked out.\u2019 In her evidence, Mrs Phillips said: \u2018I saw Ron lying on the bulkhead and this great big guy going boof, boof, boof [she made a punching motion]. 'He must have hit him five times. I put my hand on his arm and told him, \u201cleave him alone, you will kill him\u201d.\u2019 Prosecutor Lewis Kerr told the court that Mr Phillips suffered facial injuries. His wife was pushed against a wall and also knocked unconscious. She was found to have suffered two broken vertebrae. The crew of the Celebration found bed sheets and a T-shirt in Finlay\u2019s cabin with blood marks. He was not on the ship, which was in port at the time of the discovery, but when he returned he was told to make his own way back to his home in Glasgow. Mr Kerr said: \u2018The defendant was interviewed by the police and explained he had an argument with Mr and Mrs Phillips. \u2018He accepts he hit Mr Phillips but didn\u2019t accept causing the injuries to Mrs Phillips. He said he was only ever acting in self-defence.\u2019 Teesside Crown Court, pictured, heard how crew members discovered a bloodstained T-shirt and bed sheets in Mr Finlay's cabin. He denies unlawfully wounding Mr Phillips and causing Mrs Phillips grievous bodily harm . It was alleged that after dinner Finlay had shared a lift with Mr and Mrs Phillips and told them: \u2018You ignored me, I want an apology.\u2019 Peter Kilgour, defending, put it to Mr Phillips that he swore at the defendant and \u2018lashed out at him\u2019 with his crutch. Mr Phillips replied: \u2018No. Never in my life have I hit anyone, not even my wife, you can ask her.\u2019 He said there was no row in the lift and that he was attacked without warning. He also denied snubbing Finlay at dinner, insisting: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t ignore someone who had sat down at my table. We were in the restaurant for 45 minutes to an hour and didn\u2019t see him again. We just chatted to the other couple. There was no disagreement.\u2019 Finlay denies unlawfully wounding Mr Phillips and causing Mrs Phillips grievous bodily harm. The case continues.

{"article": "If you were spellbound by the death-defying adventures of Katniss Everdeen, you will be very excited by the news that a Hunger Games theme park is in the planning. And fans could have the chance to experience Katniss' life as soon as next year, with the attraction expected to open in October 2016. But those looking to\u00a0wield\u00a0their bows and act as tribute will have to travel to Dubai for the chance to emulate the mockingjay. Hopefully the Dubai theme park will have safety measures in place for guests - unlike Katniss' experience in the arena in Hunger Games . The four million square foot Motiongate Dubai is set to attract over three million tourists annually, who will be\u00a0immersed in a cinematic journey through their favourite movies via 27 different latest-in-technology rides and attractions. Contrasting with the dramatic and nail-biting theme of the Hunger Games is the incorporation of a live stage show based on Step Up: All In and Step Up: Revolution, the two most recent films in Liongate's worldwide franchise. So far there have been three 'Hunger Games' films released, featuring Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, grossing $2.3 billion at box offices worldwide. The final instalment, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, is debuting on Nov 20, 2015, and the theme park attractions will be open for fans less than a year later. Dubai Parks and Resorts Chief Executive Officer, Raed Al Nuaimi, said: 'We are thrilled to be working with a Hollywood studio whose creative resources, spirit of innovation and vision of the entertainment experience are so closely aligned with our own. 'Lionsgate's\u00a0Hunger Games, Step Up\u00a0and other signature properties are the perfect centerpiece for one of the most visionary new theme parks in the world. 'Through this partnership we are offering even more for the whole family to enjoy on their visit and are confident that Motiongate Dubai will set a global benchmark as the ultimate movie themed destination.' The theme park is set to open for Hunger Games fans in October 2016, and will include\u00a027 different latest-in-technology rides and attractions . The last movie in the Hunger Games franchise is set to be released in the US in November this year . Lionsgate has partnered with Dubai Parks and Resorts to bring a Lionsgate zone to motiongate\u2122 Dubai, the Hollywood-themed park opening in Dubai in October 2016 . 'Motiongate Dubai is poised to become one of the most exciting new entertainment destinations in the world, and we're thrilled that many of our biggest franchises will be an integral part of it,' said Lionsgate Executive Vice President of Global Franchise Management and Strategic Partnerships, Kerry Phelan, and Senior Vice President of Branded Attractions, Jenefer Brown. 'The Lionsgate section of Motiongate Dubai is an important milestone in our ongoing commitment to extend the longevity, broaden the global fan base and enrich the vitality of our most exciting entertainment properties.' If the Hunger Games and Step Up attractions were not enough to draw the crowds, Dubai Parks and Resorts even have plans for Legoland Dubai, the first of its kind in the Middle East. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Studios, Orlando, proved that if done correctly, theme parks can tap into a large movie fan base . Fans at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter can walk through a replica Hogwarts Castle, and enjoy three rollercoaster rides . Lionsgate were no doubt spurred on by the success of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which opened at Universal Studios, Florida in 2010. Attracting millions of fans from all over the globe, the attraction, which included Hogwarts Castle and Hogsmeade Village, was a rounding success. Universal opened an extension to the Harry Potter experience, Diagon Alley, last summer which cost an estimated \u00a3239million.", "reference": "Motiongate Dubai will open in October, 2016 with themed zones .\nGuests can enjoy rides and gift shops based on the billion dollar franchise .\nThere will also be live performances based on Step Up movies .\nThe Dubai Theme Park will be\u00a0four million square foot in size .", "pred_summary": "Motiongate Dubai will open in October 2016.\nThree 'Hunger Games' films have been released.\nThe final instalment of the series is due to debut in November 2015."}

The outspoken Rochdale candidate said it was 'unacceptable' that people who were prepared to join ISIS should be free to come home. It comes after nine members of the same family were arrested in Turkey \u2013 including the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor in Rochdale. Scroll down for video . Waheed Ahmed (right) - the son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - and his cousins walk into the Turkish Police Department's Foreigners' office today after being caught trying to cross into Syria . The family \u2013 including Councillor Shakil Ahmed's son Waheed, his cousins, aunt and four children \u2013 are expected return to the UK from Turkey this week. Coun Ahmed, 45 \u2013 who was photographed with Labour leader Ed Miliband just weeks ago \u2013 served alongside Mr Danczuk's wife Karen on the Town Council until her resignation in January. But Mr Danczuk today lashed out at suggestions that the family could be allowed to return to Britain without facing any terror charges. Speaking to MailOnline Mr Danczuk said: 'I think I speak for the vast majority of people in Rochdale in saying that this family will not be welcome back in Rochdale.' Mr Danczuk added: 'The Islamic State in Syria are carrying out sickening and barbaric acts of inhumanity and anyone who pledges their allegiance to this cruel and twisted ideology will rightly be seen as an enemy of the UK. 'Waheed and his family were apprehended trying to get into Syria and had they been allowed to cross the border then I've been given to believe Waheed would now be getting trained up to fight for ISIS. Mr Danczuk said they were not welcome back in Rochdale . 'The police have to recognize this, because the idea that someone who was prepared to join a terrorist outfit like ISIS could be allowed to return to civilian life in Rochdale and carry on as though nothing has happened is unacceptable.' It shares a border with part of Syria controlled by rebel factions including those linked to Al Qaeda and ISIS. The Rochdale nine are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory. The three men and two women, aged between 21 and 47, were taken to a hospital with their children, aged one, three, eight and 11 after being apprehended last week. Photographs showed Waheed Ahmed, dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots, leading the group from a minibus into a police station. Several women, all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces, could be seen carrying children. Most of the party were wearing walking boots, perfect for trekking across the rugged region. Turkey is a key staging ground for foreign fighters and others hoping to reach Islamic State-held areas of Syria and Iraq. The Ahmed family are originally from Kashmir but settled in Rochdale in the 1980s and have lived in their current home since 2006. Coun Ahmed posted a picture of himself with Labour leader Ed Miliband on his Facebook page just before Christmas. Their arrest came after Yahya Rashid, 19, was charged with preparing acts of terrorism after flying into Luton Airport from Istanbul.

Waheed smiled in a car as he left a hospital after undergoing medical checks and fingerprinting in Hatay southern of Turkey last week . He is suspected of acting as an Islamic State smuggler, paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group. Mr Danczuk said the number of Britons fleeing the country to join ISIS \u2013 now thought to number more than 600 \u2013 exposed the failure of the Government's anti-terror strategy. He said: 'I have spent the last few days in discussions with the Foreign Office minister, Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner, local authority leaders, religious groups and local people.' Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said the British family caught trying to cross into would be forced to train up as ISIS fighters . The outspoken candidate added: 'The message coming back to me loud and clear is that while the vast majority reject this ideology of hatred, exclusion and intolerance, there are some people who are susceptible to radicalization.

'It is said that there is a history of inbreeding in Norway and that there is a high incidence of Down syndrome among Norwegian children,' he told Norway's NRK channel. 'They argue therefore that it is important for Norwegian authorities to obtain fresh, foreign children, such as Lithuanian ones, to strengthen the genetic material.'

{"article": "According to a woman who is apparently against the preachings of Andrew Caldwell, the St. Louis man got his just desserts. The 21-year-old became somewhat infamous late last year for video of him screaming 'I don't like mens no more - I like women, women, women!' after a pastor at an evangelical megachurch claimed to have cured his homosexuality. Caldwell hit headlines in November after the footage surfaced of him being 'delivered' by God. But he says he was attacked by an employee at a FroYo in Delmar on Wednesday after the cashier recognized him. He ended up completely doused in his own dessert at the counter.

Doused in dessert: Caldwell claimed Diaz attacked him because she disagreed with his ideals about being 'cured'. However Diaz said he demanded a discount and called her a 'dog' Heated confrontation over frozen yogurt: Caldwell was covered in FroYo, and said his bowl was extra large . Megachurch star:\u00a0Andrew Caldwell in a still from a video of him speaking during a Church of God in Christ Convention in St. Louis last year, where he infamously said he 'don't like mens no more' Caldwell claims the employee recognized him from his video at the Church of God in Christ's 107th Holy Convocation. He said the woman called him a gay slur, said that it was impossible for God to 'turn' gay people straight, and then picked up the extra large bowl from the scale at the counter and aggressively threw it in Caldwell's face, according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. However the employee, Stephanie Diaz, says Caldwell is a liar. In an interview with the same TV station, Diaz said Caldwell demanded a discount for his yogurt. When she didn't relent, he called her a 'dog' and a 'b----', Diaz said. Diaz, who is openly gay, said it had nothing to do with the viral video. 'I threw the ice cream at him,' she said outside of the store Thursday. 'He called me a dog. \u2026 I lost it.'

Comfortably straight: Andrew Caldwell, seen here in a recent photo from his Facebook page, happily announced last year that God had cured his homosexuality and that he had been 'delivered' CCTV footage released of the incident shows Caldwell throwing money at Diaz. That is when Diaz throws the yogurt. The FroYo store released the footage to show Caldwell was lying. Diaz said she had never seen the church video or heard of Caldwell. She has been charged with third-degree assault. However Diaz has not been fired. FroYo have said any punishment that should occur from the incident will be handled internally. Stylish: Caldwell is pictured here dressed in head-to-toe designer clothing on his Facebook page . Caldwell says he is considering suing Diaz and FroYo. In he video of Caldwell being 'delivered' that went viral, he announces into the microphone: 'I\u2019m not gay no more! I am delivered! I don\u2019t like mens no more! I said I like women! Women, women, women! I said women! I\u2019m not gay! I will not date a man! I will not carry a purse! I will not put on makeup! I will love a woman.' The megachurch audience can be heard screaming and cheering in the background, congratulating Caldwell on no longer being gay. The pastor then hands him $100, saying the Lord told him to. After the video spread, Caldwell - who was extravagantly dressed in a paisley suit, purple shirt and mustard bow tie - did a series of interviews, where he said he meant what he said, but was unhappy the video became so popular.

{"article": "Hibs boss Alan Stubbs is among the front-runners for the manager's job at Wigan Athletic after Malky Mackay was sensationally sacked on Monday. Stubbs is currently embroiled in a tough promotion battle with the Easter Road side, but is believed to be among Wigan's top targets as they battle to avoid relegation from the Championship \u2014 they are currently second bottom. Stubbs' No2, John Doolan, formed part of Uwe Rosler's backroom staff at the DW Stadium before the German was sacked in November. Hibs boss Alan Stubbs has emerged as a candidate to succeed Malky Mackay after he was sacked by Wigan . Malky Mackay was sensationally sacked by Wigan Athletic following a dismal run of results since November . Doolan joined Stubbs in Edinburgh in July last year and both men \u2014 who also worked together at Everton's youth academy \u2014 are highly regarded by new Wigan chairman David Sharpe. Former Celtic defender Stubbs who is on a two-year contract in Leith, has steered Hibs into the play-off positions in Scotland's second tier, albeit they have stumbled of late after three successive defeats. However, he would face an altogether different challenge with Wigan. They are eight points from safety after the 2-0 home defeat by Derby spelled the end for Mackay, and must win their next two games against Fulham and Millwall to stand any chance of survival. Former Scotland defender Gary Caldwell is expected to be handed the job on a temporary basis, while ex-Wigan player Danny Wilson is also under consideration. Former Wigan defender Gary Caldwell looks set to be handed the manager's role on a temporary basis . Meanwhile, Mackay's bid to rescue his managerial career was left in tatters after his dismissal. The 43-year-old was told of the decision during a brief meeting with Sharpe after losing to Derby. Mackay was handed the job by former owner Dave Whelan back in November against a backdrop of an FA investigation into a shocking series of text messages, exposed by Sportsmail. Cardiff City manager at the time, Mackay is accused of sending racist, sexist and homophobic messages in an exchange with former head of recruitment Iain Moody. The Scot remains under investigation by the FA and Monday's developments will not alter the speed with which his case is dealt. Sharpe, just a month into his new role as chairman, looked forlorn after Monday's game and made a snap decision to axe the Scot. Mackay won only five of his 25 fixtures in charge and picked up just three home points \u2014 damning statistics referenced in the club's official statement. Sharpe said: 'This is a very difficult decision to make but I feel that, for the long-term future of the club, there must be a change now.' Sportsmail understands Mackay was close to suffering the sack in February but victory at Reading granted him a stay of execution. Wigan were content with keeping him until at least the end of the season and kept faith with the divisive figure. Sources at the DW Stadium also indicated that Mackay was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at Cardiff and had been sanctioned to do so. He remained defiant they could stay in the division immediately after losing against Derby. 'It's still mathematically possible,' he said. 'It's fine lines between winning and losing in this league.' Wigan chairman David Sharpe has said that it was a 'very difficult' decision to sack Mackay on Monday .", "reference": "Alan Stubbs is among the\u00a0front-runners\u00a0to succeed Malky Mackay after he was sacked by\u00a0Wigan Athletic on Monday .\nHibs are currently battling for promotion from the Scottish championship .\nStubbs' assistant John Doolan was part of Uwe Rosler's backroom staff at Wigan before he was sacked by the club .", "pred_summary": "Alan Stubbs tipped to succeed Malky Mackay after the Scot is sacked by Wigan.\nStubbs was formerly in Uwe Rosler's backroom staff before the German was sacked in November.\nHibs boss is currently embroiled in a tough promotion battle with the Easter Road side."}

Karen Wakefield and her husband Paul Dawson were one of a number of families who featured on the six-part BBC documentary, which aimed to show what life was like in Harpurhey in Manchester. It was criticised by those who starred in it as intentionally painting them in a negative light. Mrs Wakefield, who runs Wishy Washy launderette in the town, is due to appear in court after she refused to pay fines for taking her 13-year-old daughter out of school for six days to go on holiday to Turkey. Karen Wakefield and her partner Paul (centre) could face three months in jail for refusing to pay fines for taking her 13-year-old daughter  (right) out of school during term time to go on holiday to Turkey . She has refused to pay\u00a0two initial \u00a360 fines and subsequent \u00a3120 fines, and claims she and her husband have been told they could be jailed for three months or given fines of \u00a31,000 each. The mother-of-two said she\u00a0'doesn't like being told by teachers when she can go on holiday' and said she is determined to fight the case all the way. Mrs Wakefield said her daughter's school, the Manchester Communication Academy, refused to give her permission to take her daughter abroad during term last year. The trip, at the end of the six-weeks' holiday, meant the pupil missed six days of lessons at the start of the new school year. She said her child deserved the trip because of alleged bullying at the school. Mrs Wakefield said she doesn't like the school telling her what to do, and took her daughter out of Manchester Communication Academy during term time to go on holiday . Mrs Wakefield claims her daughter  needed a holiday after she was bullied at school . The owner of Wishy Washy was seen showing viewers CCTV from \u00a0the launderette of some of her customers . Mrs Wakefield, who has another daughter Amber, 21, added: 'We told the truth and told the school we were going on holiday. We didn't lie and say she was ill or anything. 'But they said we didn't have permission. She deserved to go on holiday - she's been bullied at the school. She's had a hard time of it. 'We refused to pay the fines - it's ridiculous. We don't like being told when you can go on holiday by teachers. The six-part BBC Three documentary was watched by 1million people. Producers said the fly-on-the-wall documentary aimed to show what life was like in Manchester. But locals who featured in the show claimed the show was 'faked' to make them appear drunken, fat and lazy. More than 300 people attended a public meeting to call for the series to be axed, claiming rather than showing how\u00a0Harpurhey had developed - it illustrated it as a deprived area. They said the show made them look like 'Jeremy Kyle Show-type chavs' - a talk show which frequently features swearing and fighting. Locals claimed they were tricked into taking part and encouraged to drink alcohol and fight on camera by the film crew. This was flatly denied by production company Dragonfly. 'What about when they're on strike or there's a training day? It's no different to her missing a few days on holiday. 'It would be different if her grades were low but she is very clever and doing better than expected despite being bullied.' A spokeswoman for the school said Manchester City Council is pursuing legal action on its behalf. A council spokesman said: 'Local authorities have a statutory obligation to take action on non- attendance in schools, and although schools work very closely with pupils and parents to ensure pupils are in school every day they should be, legal action is sometimes necessary to enforce this.'

'Nobody should be judged by their size because everyone is beautiful': The mum-of-twins had posted the images with an inspirational caption, and was shocked when they were removed due to 'nudity and violence' Hannah says the blocking of her account has made her think her body is 'clearly fat, ugly and disgusting and it made people feel sick'. She said: 'Two minutes after the picture was uploaded my account got closed down, my mouth just dropped and my eyes watered. 'I don't know why, it was out of the blue but I decided to post a picture of my belly on Instagram because I've had twins. 'I had written underneath the picture how unconfident I had always been, how relationships have been hard and how hard it is to find clothes that I like.' The 20-year-old had had suffered stretchmarks after having twins and wanted a confidence boost, but after posting images (pictured right), her account was immediately shut down . 'Instagram should be more careful in whose accounts they delete and look into it further': Moore was devastated by Instagram's decision to delete her account . She continued: 'I want not just myself but other women thin or bigger to love themselves and love their size because everyone is beautiful. 'Instagram should be more careful whose accounts they delete and look into it further.' Hannah suffered from stretch marks after giving birth to twin girls Lily and Grace with fiance David Johnstone, 22, in June last year. She posted the pictures on Wednesday but her account was immediately shut down. She said: 'I basically wrote that people should never get judged for the size and what they look like because everyone is beautiful'. 'The picture was up two minutes until my Instagram logged out itself and then it came up saying my account has been shut down because of violations. 'Nobody could get on my Instagram and nobody could search for it so someone had obviously reported the picture for nudity - all it was was a picture of my belly and it has just took my confidence away.' Hannah suffered from stretch marks after giving birth to twin girls Lily and Grace with fiance David Johnstone, 22 (pictured right), in June last year . She added: 'It was just me saying that nobody should ever get judged no matter what size they are. 'I felt so confident posting the picture showing my baby belly, my belly that carried twin girls for only six months.' Instagram's community guidelines state: 'We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don't allow nudity on Instagram. 'Photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed.' But Hannah believes she is not in breach of these guidelines despite her account being shut down. Instagram has admitted the incident was 'a technical mistake' and has re-instated Hannah's account . Hannah, who was bullied during school for her weight, has been left with no confidence. She said: 'It made me think that my body is clearly fat, ugly and disgusting and it made people feel sick. 'I wrote that no one should ever get judged or brought down by their size because it shouldn't matter. 'Now that nice weather is here I still feel that I need to cover myself up. I can't go out without covering my arms or legs, I just feel like people are looking at me and are disgusted.' Instagram has admitted the incident was 'a technical mistake' and has re-instated Hannah's account. A spokeswoman said: 'It was a technical mistake and the account has been restored.'", "reference": "Hannah Moore posted photos of her stretchmarks to Instagram to inspire .\nThe 20 year old suffered from marks after giving birth to twins last year .\nInstagram then deleted Hannah from Broxburn, West Lothian's account .", "pred_summary": "Hannah Moore uploaded pictures of her post-pregnancy stretchmarks in bid to boost her confidence.\nMum-of-two says images were removed due to 'nudity and violence'\nInstagram says incident was 'a technical mistake' and has re-instated Hannah's account."}
{"article": "This spot in Colorado's Vail Valley is so picturesque that a family stopped at nothing to build their home here - even if it meant shelling out $1 million just on the driveway. The Italian-inspired mansion, which has incredible 360-degree views across the mountains, has now gone on the market for a tidy $29.5 million. Homeowner Dick Rothkopf, a former toy company chief, chose the location for the estate in 2008 because his family enjoyed hiking in the nearby hills. But the property is so remote that it took two years, a team of engineers and $1 million to build the 1.5-mile driveway from the roadway to its front door, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal reported. Incredible: This Italian-inspired mansion in the mountains of Vail, Colorado has gone on sale for $29.5 million . Stunning: The home, which was built in 2008, is made from materials brought over from the homeowner's trips to Italy . Spacious: Inside the 13,000-square-foot home is a spacious gourmet kitchen, which is perfect for entertaining guests . Opulent: The entire property has eight bedrooms and eight full bathrooms over two buildings, as well as an outdoor barn .

The home, which is known as 'Il Podere' - meaning 'family homestead' - was built on 230 acres of land using\u00a0materials collected during the Rothkopfs' trips to Italy. It features a main residence with seven bedrooms, seven full bathrooms, three half bathrooms, an elevator and a gourmet kitchen across 13,000 square foot. There's also a billiard room,\u00a0a gym, an indoor basketball court and a home theater. Outside is a pool with a spa and sauna, a pool house, a two-car garage and a tennis court, as well as a lake, a pond, a stream and stunning views. Comfortable: A massive fireplace in a living room offers comfortable nights in for humans and pets alike . Hidden: Beneath arches and down walkways are recreation rooms for both children and adults . Airy: Large windows and terraces give terrific views across the Vail Valley in Colorado . Beautiful: As well as an office, the main home has seven bedrooms and seven full bathrooms . Fully equipped: A large gym can also be found at the home, as well as a spa and a sauna . Luxury: There is a movie theater inside the home, as well as a billiard room and an indoor basketball court . Serene: The home is 25 minutes from Vail's ski slopes and less than two hours from Aspen . Picturesque: The family who built the property chose this spot in Vail because they enjoyed hiking there . There is also a 2,000-square-foot caretaker's house, with one bedroom and one-and-a-half bathrooms, while a separate barn also houses a loft and a bathroom. And if the home itself doesn't offer enough entertainment, it's just 25 minutes from Vail's ski slopes,\u00a0an hour and 45 minutes from Aspen and two hours from Denver. The listing with Douglas Elliman\u00a0calls the estate 'breathtakingly beautiful, tranquil, pristine'. The family is leaving to build a home in Sonoma, California but plans to buy a smaller place in Vail so they can still make use of its slopes. Large: As well as a separate building for a caretaker, the estate also has a barn with a loft and a bathroom . Determined: Its current owners were intent on living at the location so built a $1 million to the house . Vistas: A swimming pool and terrace area gives unobstructed views across the valley .

{"article": "Ricky Gervais has led an online charge against 'trophy hunters' after posting a picture of an Extreme Huntress winner lying next to a dead giraffe and smiling. The comedian was outraged when he came across the picture of American grandmother-of-nine Rebecca Francis, who won the reality TV show Extreme Huntress in 2010. 'What must've happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling?' a furious Gervais tweeted. Trophy: Ricky Gervais posted this picture of Extreme Huntress winner Rebecca Francis on his Twitter feed . Disgust: The animal-lover sent it out with this message - which got retweeted thousands of times . Proud: Francis, a grandmother-of-nine, is passionate about hunting - and regularly posts pictures of her kills . Francis then found herself at the centre of a social media storm, as 14,543 people retweeted it - with some even tweeting they hoped she dies 'a lonely, painful death'. Jason Arnopp (\u200f@JasonArnopp) tweeted: 'It's a special kind of psychopathy, it really is.' The Doom \u200f(@JamesVonDoom) added: 'Why the **** are they shooting Giraffes? A standing giraffe is probably easier to hit than a \"sitting duck\".' Despite the outcry, Francis, a mother of eight in her mid-40s, is far from alone in her passion for hunting down animals for sport. Tens of thousands of tourists travel to Africa every year to collect 'trophies', from warthogs to elephants. Those wanting to hunt down giraffes to add to their collections can do so quite easily, with entire tour companies dedicated to the 'sport'. Killing a giraffe will cost somewhere in the region of $3,000, or \u00a32,037, with the cost of the day's hunting on top - about $440 (\u00a3298). Extreme: Francis' biography reveals she hopes to inspire more women to get involved with hunting . Global: She has travelled all over the world to hunt - shooting dead zebra, lion and giraffes . Record: Francis has recently achieved the 'Grand Slam of North America' - hunting down all the species of sheep native to the continent with her bow. She is only the second woman to achieve the feat . But while those like Gervais are horrified by the idea, Francis is a proud advocate for the sport - which has seen her travel the world in search of the latest 'trophy'. Indeed, a biography for Francis on Sheepshape - a 'documentary/reality' programme which follows four hunters trying to overcome a set of personal problems by hunting North American sheep - says: 'Rebecca loves to share her passion for hunting with her kids and other women. 'She hopes to help more women get out there and pursue their interest.' Her own website boasts of becoming the second American woman to get the 'Grand Slam of North America' with her bow - which means she has killed all four species native to North America. 'Achieving the full curl with a bow is like reaching the top of that mountain and crossing that finish line, which was my dream that began 18 years ago when I came home from my first rifle sheep hunt,' she told the Unita County Herald. The MailOnline has contacted Francis for a comment.", "reference": "Comedian Ricky Gervais led an online charge against Rebecca Francis .\nThe Brit shared a picture of the grandmother lying next to her 'trophy'\nCaused to an online backlash against Francis - with 14,543 retweeting post .\nFrancis is proud of hunting and hopes to inspire more women to take part .", "pred_summary": "Ricky Gervais sparks fury after posting picture of Extreme Huntress winner lying next to a dead giraffe.\n14,543 people retweeted it - with some saying they hoped she died 'a lonely, painful death'"}
{"article": "Teenagers will be encouraged to learn foreign languages by talking about tattoos, music festivals, YouTube and rap music under the latest GCSE shake-up . Teenagers will be encouraged to learn foreign languages by talking about tattoos, music festivals, YouTube and rap music under the latest GCSE shake-up. Exam board officials yesterday unveiled a draft syllabus for 14 to 16-year-olds which they said would \u2018make content more contemporary\u2019. Some students will be asked to study a review of a gritty 15-rated foreign film, while others will look at Spanish tweets on the Olympic Games. The proposals, announced by Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR), aim to rid classrooms of \u2018tired phrases\u2019 which some pupils now see as outdated. The board said children were \u2018uninspired\u2019 by conventional topics like \u2018my school day\u2019, \u2018my pencil case\u2019 and \u2018my family\u2019. It said the new French, German and Spanish GCSEs would allow pupils to talk about their interests using updated content. Exam board officials also hope to \u2018bring back linguistic skills\u2019 by focusing on grammar as a component of an indispensable language \u2018toolkit\u2019. OCR languages expert Katherine Smith said: \u2018This entails moving away from working too long on a clich\u00e9d topic until a student is bored with it, to working on more appealing subjects, and with an all-important shift in emphasis on the skills that they can transfer across content. \u2018Current GCSE specifications have focused on preparing coursework which is more about the theme than learning the building blocks of a language. \u2018This has de-skilled students and led to \u2018topic fatigue\u2019. Our new approach should fundamentally improve both the student\u2019s enjoyment and their linguistic ability.\u2019 The course content, which has now been submitted to Ofqual for approval, would be studied by pupils from 2016. The board said it had disposed of old topics including \u2018My holiday\u2019, \u2018Aur\u00e9lie and Fabian go to town\u2019 or \u2018Mathilde\u2019s school day\u2019. One teacher at an OCR teacher consultation said: \u2018Students are not really going to meet somebody in a caf\u00e9 in Paris and describe their entire family.\u2019 Pupils would no longer be forced to recite phrases like \u2018I have a grapefruit every morning\u2019 and instead would be able to express views such as \u2018In my opinion a discreet tattoo is an expression of your personality\u2019. In the new draft German GCSE, there is a film review of the thriller Run Lola Run, which is rated 15 and features some mild violence. In the Spanish GCSE, students will be asked to look at tweets on the Olympic Games. Exam board officials yesterday unveiled a draft syllabus for 14 to 16-year-olds which they said would \u2018make content more contemporary\u2019 Other proposed content includes listening to a radio broadcast on rap music and discussing online gaming and YouTube. Potential topics include Cannes Film Festival, volunteering abroad and foreign food. Experts said the new content would take inspiration from methods used to teach English as a foreign language. Literature extracts will be also be studied at the request of the Department for Education, including passages from an Ionesco play. OCR also wants to abandon inflexible vocabulary lists and encourage pupils to use a smart app to help them memorise words. Ms Smith added: \u2018While language teachers are pulling their hair out as their student numbers decline with languages not prioritised by the current system, captains of industry are also deeply frustrated. \u2018We are passionate about getting these three core language GCSEs right to help the UK build a generation of people with the language skills that are so desperately needed.\u2019", "reference": "Exam board officials yesterday unveiled draft syllabus for kids aged 14-16 .\nSome students will be asked to study review of gritty 15-rated foreign film .\nOther GCSE pupils will look at Spanish tweets on the Olympic Games .\nProposals\u00a0aim to rid classes of \u2018tired phrases\u2019 now through to be outdated .", "pred_summary": "Teenagers will be encouraged to learn foreign languages by talking about tattoos, music festivals, YouTube and rap music.\nOxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations aim to rid classrooms of 'tired phrases'"}
{"article": "A new comprehensive study of 3.9million military personnel who served after 9/11 has found no direct link between deployment to a war zone and elevated suicide rates. Researchers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington, concluded that military suicides may be more likely after members leave the service than during active duty deployment, particularly if their time in uniform is brief. \u2018It was certainly intuitive as the wars went on and suicides went up for people to assume that deployment was the reason, but our data show that that is too simplistic; when you look at the total population, deployment is not associated with suicide,\u2019 said lead author Mark Reger. New study:\u00a0Researchers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord looked at military records of\u00a03.9million personnel who served after 9/11 and found no direct link between deployment to a war zone and elevated suicide rates . Matter of honor: Service members with a dishonorable discharge were about twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had an honorable separation . The four-year study, the largest of its kind, was published Wednesday in the Journal of American Medicine Association Psychiatry. While the US military has traditionally experienced lower suicide rates than the civilian population, suicides among active duty service members have surged in the past decade, almost doubling in the Army and the Marines Corps, Reger said. In 2012, Pentagon reported 320 suicides by active-duty service members; another 268 soldiers took their lives last year. To understand the relationship between deployment and self-inflicted death, researchers reviewed military records for more than 3.9million active-duty soldiers and reservists who joined up between October 7, 2001 and December 31, 2007. A total of 31,962 deaths occurred, including 5,041 suicides, by December 31, 2009. Suicide rates were similar regardless of whether or not servicemen and women were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. The study did not factor in veterans\u2019 exposure to combat and the potential effect of traumatic events on the battlefield on suicide rates. There were 1,162 suicides among those who deployed and 3,879 among those who didn't, representing suicide rates per 100,000 person-years of 18.86 and 17.78, respectively. Leaving the military significantly increased suicide risk, however, with a suicide rate of 26.06 after separating from service compared with 15.12 for those who remained in uniform. At home and abroad:\u00a0Suicide rates were similar regardless of whether or not servicemen and women were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan . Those who left sooner had a greater risk, with a rate of 48.04 among those who spent less than a year in the military. Service members with a dishonorable discharge were about twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had an honorable separation. \u2018This is the first time such a huge, comprehensive study has found an increased suicide risk among those who have separated from service, particularly if they served for less than four years or had an other than honorable discharge,\u2019 said Rajeev Ramchand, a researcher in military mental health and suicide prevention at Rand Corporation who wasn't involved in the study. It's possible that pre-deployment examinations may screen out people who have mental health problems, making those who deploy several times a healthier, more resilient group, said Dr. Alan Peterson, a psychologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio who specializes in combat-related post traumatic stress disorder. \u2018Those who really struggle with a deployment don't go the second time,\u2019 said Peterson, a retired military psychologist who wasn't involved in the study. \u2018Early separation from the military is often a marker for something else.\u2019 For those contemplating suicide, access to firearms can exacerbate the problem, Peterson said. \u2018It's a risk factor that sometimes gets overlooked, but we've seen when they don't have access to weapons they are less likely to kill themselves.\u2019 Leaving the military significantly increased suicide risk, and those who left after just one year were most vulnerable . Some service members who leave the military early may have had risk factors for suicide such as mood disorders or substance abuse problems that contributed to their separation, particularly if they had a dishonorable discharge, said Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. It isn't realistic to expect former service members to instantly reintegrate into their former civilian lives, but they may be experiencing serious mental health problems if they're not eating or sleeping or if they're extremely agitated or irritable, Moutier said. \u2018The lack of an association between deployment and suicide risk isn't surprising,\u2019 she said. \u2018At a very high level, these findings highlight the need for us to pay closer attention to what happens when people leave the military.\u2019", "reference": "Researchers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord concluded military suicides may be more likely after members leave service than during deployment .\nThe four-year study looked at military records of 3.9million service members from October 7, 2001 to December 31, 2007 .\nTotal of 31,962 deaths occurred, including 5,041 suicides, by December 31, 2009 .\nThere were 1,162 suicides among those who deployed and 3,879 among those who didn't .\nSoldiers with a dishonorable discharge were twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had honorable discharge .", "pred_summary": "A new comprehensive study of 3.9million military personnel who served after 9/11 has found no direct link between deployment to a war zone and elevated suicide rates.\nResearchers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington, concluded that military suicides may be more likely after members leave the service.\nSuicide rates among active duty service members have surged in the past decade."}

Red is the overwhelming colour across the Football League in terms of the party that governs clubs' constituencies.

The research, undertaken by Philip Cowley, Professor of Parliamentary Government at Nottingham University, suggests football remains the working man\u2019s game, so long as Labour is the working man\u2019s party. Both Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Arsenal are all located in solid Labour seats. Kate Green, MP for Stretford and Urmston holding Old Trafford, has nearly a 9,000 majority, while Lucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, the constituency housing the Etihad Stadium, has around a 10,000 majority.

{"article": "Condemned Bali Nine pair's ongoing battle to spare their lives has moved\u00a0to Indonesia's constitutional court, a challenge that has been labelled as a delay tactic. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran lost a bid to challenge their clemency rejections in the state administrative court, which upheld its earlier decision that presidential decrees were outside its jurisdiction on Monday . As Jakarta waits on the legal efforts of a few other prisoners before setting an execution date, the two Australian's lawyers\u00a0sought a constitutional court review to make clear the president's obligations on considering clemency on Thursday - a process that could take several months. Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) are now appealing to Indonesia's constitutional court . Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has declared the move by the pair's lawyers as a delay tactic . They also intend to challenge the barrier preventing foreign citizens from constitutional court appeals. However, Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has dismissed the challenge as delaying tactics and says he won't recognise it. Indonesian lawyer for the death row pair, Inneke Kusuma, told reporters the effort was not aimed at delaying the executions, but clarifying a prisoner's rights. The president's obligations when assessing a prisoner's life were unclear, she argued, such as the weight that should be given to rehabilitation. 'This judicial review won't delay the executions but we will tell the government please hold on until this process is done, because if the constitutional court accepts what we lodge, the documents, maybe there will be a new mechanism to consider their clemency,' she said. The pair's lawyers also intend to challenge the barrier preventing foreign citizens from constitutional court appeals . Sukumaran (left) and Chan (right) are now imprisoned on Central Java's Nusakambangan island where they face the prospect of death by firing squad . The lawyers' argument is that President Joko Widodo breached his responsibilities to treat the applications for mercy on their merits, instead rejecting them because he wishes to deny clemency to all death row drug offenders. Mr Prasetyo says the pair have already had their appeals and any constitutional court decision would only apply to future cases anyway - not that of the condemned duo. Meanwhile, his spokesman Tony Spontana said an execution date that avoids the Asia-Africa Conference was still being considered, when Indonesia plays host to various heads of state from April 18 - 24. Mr Spontana said although it was legal - it would not be ethical to carry out the executions while hosting the international event but they would continue to look for a 'good day' during this month for the prisoners to face death row. The Sydney men are now imprisoned on Central Java's Nusakambangan island where they face the prospect of death by firing squad. Two of the other eight prisoners in line for execution with the Australians have applied for Supreme Court judicial reviews, while another is also pursuing an administrative court case.", "reference": "Bali Nine lawyers appeal to Indonesia's constitutional court for review .\nIndonesian Attorney-General dismisses challenge as a 'delay tactic'\nThree other death row inmates are currently appealing decision .\nIndonesia is still looking for date around hosting Asia-Africa Conference .", "pred_summary": "Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran lost bid to challenge clemency rejections in state administrative court.\nThey now appeal to Indonesia's constitutional court in a process that could take several months.\nAttorney-General HM Prasetyo has dismissed challenge as delaying tactics."}

{"article": "Comedian Sarah Silverman was forced to apologize after she was caught exaggerating a story about being paid less than a man for a gig - to highlight the gender pay gap. The comic and feminist campaigner recalled an incident at the New York Comedy Club when she claimed she was paid less than her male counterpart, for a piece she recorded a wage-discrimination-activism video for Levo League. But Silverman has been forced to apologize after New York Comedy Club owner Al Martin revealed the story was false, because Silverman had been paid less purely because she appeared as a guest on the show and wasn't meant to receive anything - her male counterpart Todd Barry was booked for the slot. Scroll down for video . Comedian and campaigner Sarah Silverman has been forced to apologize after she used a fake story about getting paid less than her male friend to do a job, as she tried to emphasize the issue of the gender pay gap . Silverman has since publicly apologized to Martin and revealed she fabricated the story. But she stressed that critics should not use the story as a way to undermine the gender pay gap campaign. 'To the maniacs who want to use this as a chit against women\u2019s issues, I ask that you please don\u2019t. Because that would be super s****y,' she said in a statement, according to National Review. In the video, released on April 6, Silverman accused Martin of paying her $50 less than Barry to perform. She claimed while both did 15 minute back-to-back sets she was paid $10, while Barry went home with $60. 'So I went back inside and I asked the owner Al Martin and I said, \"Al, why did you pay me $10 and you paid Todd Barry $60?\"' she said. Silverman appeared in the video and was later forced to apologise for fabricating the pay gap story S . 'And he, it was so perfect. He goes, \"Oh, did you want a $60 spot?\" It was symbolic, I didn\u2019t need $60, but, you know it was pretty s****y.' She added: 'If you work a job and a man is working the same job, then you should be getting paid the same.' However Martin revealed what really happened in a Facebook post - prompting Silverman's apology. She said: 'When I was interviewed by Levo, they asked me \"Do you remember a time you were paid less for the same job\" and this story, being just that, popped into my head.' The comic said she regretted mentioning Martin by name, who had always been 'so lovely' to her. She also admitted her anecdote had not been a good example of the gender pay gap. Silverman apologized for naming club owner Al Martin in the fabricated story but said the issue around her incorrectly recounting the anecdote should not be used to undermine the campaign for wage equality . Silverman is dating Welsh actor Michael Sheen (left)  Before that, she was with Jimmy Kimmel (right) In a Facebook post Martin said he fully accepted Silverman's apology and invited her back to perform. He wrote: 'It takes a big person to apologize and and today Sarah proved she is that kind of person.' Silverman came under criticism last month after she posted a list of ten 'rape prevention tips' on Twitter. Critics blasted the comic for offering 'tips' to potential rapists while dozens of men responded by branding her sexist for suggesting that all men desire to rape women. The sarcastic set of rules, which focus on the perpetrator of the crime rather than the victim, also include 'if you are in an elevator and a woman gets in, don't rape her', as well as 'when you encounter a woman who is asleep, the safest course of action is not to rape her'.", "reference": "In campaign video Silverman said she was paid six times less than her male counterpart .\nBut the tale has been exposed as a fabrication by club owner Al Martin .\nSilverman has been forced to apologize and admitted story was wrong .\nShe was only paid less because she was a guest and man was booked .\nSaid called critics who used issue to blast pay gap campaign 'maniacs'", "pred_summary": "Comedian Sarah Silverman was forced to apologize after she was caught exaggerating a story about being paid less than a man for a gig - to highlight the gender pay gap.\nNew York Comedy Club owner Al Martin revealed the story was false because Silverman had been paid less purely because she appeared as a guest on the show and wasn't meant to receive anything."}
{"article": "Former Rangers manager Walter Smith has praised Stuart McCall for making an impact at Ibrox - but he maintains Ally McCoist was given little chance of succeeding. McCall has put Rangers in the driving seat for second place in the Scottish Championship and a place in the semi-finals of the play-offs after taking over from reluctant caretaker Kenny McDowall. McCoist was put on gardening leave just before Christmas after handing in his notice following three-and-a-half difficult seasons in charge under the chaotic reigns of the likes of Craig Whyte and then Charles Green and his allies. But his failure to win a cup competition and his team's style of play drew serious criticism. Walter Smith (right)\u00a0spent two spells in charge as manager of Rangers and has hailed Stuart McCall's impact . Smith (right) attended a John Hartson Foundation golf day to raise money for testicular cancer awareness . Smith was chairman for some of that period after accepting Green's offer to join the board - a decision he soon regretted - and insists the club was too badly run to ensure true success on the park. Smith, who was attending a John Hartson Foundation golf day to help raise money for testicular cancer awareness, said: 'The guys worked with me for four-and-a-half years there and did a great job for the club, and I was hoping they would get a good opportunity. 'I got great support from Sir David Murray but it's not turned out that they have had the same support from the people who have been running the club. So it has been very difficult for them to show what they can do. 'That's the crux of the matter, it's the circumstances they have been in that have caused them as much trouble as anything else. 'I'd be very surprised if anybody could show me a club that isn't well run, that are doing really well. 'The problems have been well documented and now they have got to concentrate on doing what they do, and that's Rangers getting back to the Premiership first and foremost and then trying to settle into a position where they can get back to being a winning team.' McCall played under Smith for seven seasons, winning six titles in the process, and the 67-year-old was pleased to see the former Motherwell boss take over, despite his pain at the exits of former assistants McCoist and McDowall. McCall was appointed Rangers manager in March until the summer as a replacement for Kenny McDowall . 'I'm not happy to see it because it cost friends of mine their job,' he said. 'But that happens in football and when other people take over I am obviously pleased to see Stuart take over and I hope he does really well. 'He has been brave enough to take the job until the end of the season. If he gets promotion, he will put himself in a very good position to get the job on a more permanent basis. 'He has gone in there and got a reaction. That happens in football. It has happened to me and a whole load of other managers, when you leave and someone else comes in, they get a reaction. Rangers have won five out of nine Scottish Championship matches since McCall's arrival at Ibrox . 'Performances have been brighter and hopefully he will keep that going until the end of the season.' However, Smith has warned that Rangers fans might have to be patient in their desire to see the club competing at the very top of Scottish football, despite power now lying in the hands of the likes of Paul Murray and Dave King following last month's general meeting. 'I'm obviously happy to see everything at the club settling down,' the former Scotland boss said. 'The lack of headlines would indicate that's the case. 'The people that are running the club are just getting their feet under the table and finding out what they have to do to move the club forward. I think that's to be expected at this stage. Smith did, however, open up about Ally McCoist's departure and admitted it wasn't easy to see . 'It will obviously take a bit of time but they will be able to handle that aspect of it. Everyone who is there now is there for the football club and that's a big, big thing. 'To be fair, when I was involved on the Rangers board, it would have been different from any other boardroom never mind anything else. 'I have been fortunate enough to be at Rangers for a long time and be there at successful times and it's not a period I can look back on with any great pleasure.'", "reference": "Walter Smith spent two spells in charge at Ibrox as manager of Rangers .\nStuart McCall was appointed Rangers manager in March until the summer .\nRangers are currently fifth in the Scottish Championship .\nSmith hails McCall impact and\u00a0opens up about Ally McCoist's departure .", "pred_summary": "Walter Smith says Ally McCoist was given little chance of succeeding at Ibrox.\nFormer Rangers manager says the club is not well run by the current board.\nSmith spent two spells in charge of the Scottish club between 2003 and 2008."}

And because of the potential supernatural significance of liquid mercury in ritual ends, deeper into the complex Gomez hopes to find the elusive last resting place of a king. Scroll down for video . Hope: Mexican archaeologist Sergio Gomez has been excavating a pre-Aztec pyramid in Teotihuacan, Mexico, for six years and came across 'large quantities' of liquid mercury earlier this month . Underground: Gomez announced on Friday that he found the liquid mercury in a chamber at the end of a tunnel (pictured) that had been sealed off for more than 1,800 years . 'It's something that completely surprised us,' Gomez said at . the entrance to the tunnel below Teotihuacan's Pyramid of the . Plumed Serpent, about 30 miles  northeast of Mexico City. If Gomez is right, it could help settle a debate over how power was wielded in Teotihuacan, a city boasting massive stone pyramids that was home to as many as 200,000 people and the heart of ancient empire that flourished between 100 and 700 A.D. Some archaeologists believe the toxic element could herald . what would be the first ruler's tomb ever found in Teotihuacan, . a contemporary of several ancient Maya cities, but so shrouded . in mystery that its inhabitants still have no name. Unsure why the mercury was put there, Gomez says the metal . may have been used to symbolize an underworld river or lake. Though mercury has previously been uncovered in small amounts at a few Maya sites much . further south, it had never been found in Teotihuacan. Mercury was rare in ancient Mexico, as it was difficult to mine and prized for its reflective properties. Archaeologists believe it may . have had a supernatural significance for ritual ends. Teotihuacan, or 'abode of the gods' in the Aztec language of . Nahuatl, was distinct from the Mayan civilization. Royalty: Gomez said that he is unsure as to why the mercury was in the tunnel (pictured), but he hopes that it will lead him to the tomb of the city's king . Digging: National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) archaeologists work at a tunnel that may lead to a royal tombs discovered at the ancient city of Teotihuacan in 2011. Gomez said their findings could lead to settling the debate as to how power was distributed in the city . Its . inhabitants left behind no written record, abandoning the city . long before the Aztecs came to power in the 14th Century. Spaniards dug at Teotihuacan in the 1670s, but rigorous . scientific excavation of the site did not begin until the 1950s. Gomez's six-year slog in the tunnel has already yielded tens . of thousands of artifacts including stone sculptures, fine . jewelry and giant seashells leading to the three chambers. The . painstaking excavation has slowed due to extreme humidity, mud, . and now, the need for protective gear to avoid mercury . poisoning. George Cowgill, a U.S. archaeologist who has spent more than . four decades excavating Teotihuacan, says the mercury find . increases the odds of finding a tomb. 'But it's still very uncertain, and that is what keeps . everybody in suspense,' he added. Mexican archaeologist Linda Manzanilla believes that at its . peak, the city was ruled not by a single king, but a council of . four lords, and that Gomez may find the remains of one of them. To bolster her argument, she cites the absence of a single . palace or the presence of kings in any of the city's many . murals. The excavation of the chambers should be finished by .

Griffin and Ben Jones-Bishop scored tries in the first half, although Jack Hughes gave the Giants hope. Carl Forster's try and Griffin's penalty made the game safe, though, despite the prolific Aaron Murphy's try setting up a tense finish. Salford Red Devils secured a second win in a row with a 18-12 victory at Huddersfield . Salford made a fast start and Cory Paterson had a try ruled out on 18 minutes. A Rangi Chase kick-through was fumbled by a Giants player in the in-goal area and Paterson pounced but referee James Child had already ruled it a knock-on and given the Red Devils a drop out. The game was twice delayed early on when Kevin Locke for Salford and Huddersfield's Brett Ferres were carried off injured. Griffin opened the scoring on 21 minutes when he pounced on a mistake by Huddersfield's Jermaine McGillvary. The winger seemed set to grab a grubber kick into the left corner by Jones-Bishop - but when he slipped in the in-goal area Griffin was there to score. He failed to convert but was on target 10 minutes later after Jones-Bishop took advantage of more slack defending. Rangi Chase kicked through straight from a scrum and Jones-Bishop got to the ball first despite several Giants players being better placed. Lacklustre Huddersfield, seeking a fifth straight win, woke up after that and were back in the contest on 38 minutes. On-loan Wigan forward Hughes went over from Jamie Ellis' pass after good work by Eorl Crabtree. There was a flare-up on half-time when Crabtree and Weller Hauraki came to blows after the Kiwi made a heavy tackle on the England international. Salford extended their 10-6 half-time lead on 55 minutes when Forster grabbed his first try of the season. Griffin, the older brother of fellow former Huddersfield player Darrell, who was on the bench for this match, converted.

A thug beat up his girlfriend so badly after a cancelled New Year's Eve party that their hotel room resembled a 'bloodbath', a court has heard. Steven Howie, 28, of Dunfermline, left his girlfriend Karen Murray, 31, with 18 separate injuries after assaulting her over  an hour. Howie, a joiner, punched, kicked and kneed her during a prolonged assault, smashed furnishings, and pulled the door of their en-suite bathroom off its hinges. Because the inn was so isolated Miss Murray was unable to get a signal to call police and officers only arrived after guests in another room dialled 999. Stirling Sheriff Court heard that Howie and Miss Murray had been dating for about four months when they checked into the Carronbridge Hotel, in the Campsie Fells. The court heard they then travelled into Stirling for Hogmanay celebrations at Stirling Castle, which were meant to have been headlined by The Waterboys. Lindsey Brooks, prosecuting, said that 'alcohol was consumed' and at one point there was an argument about Howie speaking to another female. Miss Brooks said the argument was quickly resolved, but the Stirling Castle event was cancelled due to bad weather and the pair took a taxi back to the hotel about 10.30pm. When they got back to their room Howie began to shout and swear at Miss Murray calling her a whore and a liar. The depute fiscal said: 'Miss Murray said it came out of the blue. The accused then punched her in the face, causing her nose to bleed, punched her in the stomach, and kneed her in the back numerous times. The couple were staying at the Carronbridge Hotel (pictured) when he beat her in a brutal and sustained attack . 'Miss Murray was unsure how long this went on for, but she was able eventually to get the accused out of the room and lock the door. 'She was unable to call the police because of poor phone reception. 'A couple staying in the room next door heard a disturbance ongoing on and off for about an hour. They heard male voice being abusive, and banging, and a female crying.' The court heard half an hour later the couple heard a male voice saying 'open the door, I'll kill you' and a woman shouting 'go away'. They phoned police who found Howie in the hotel car park, heavily intoxicated, with blood on his t-shirt. Miss Murray was still in the room, which had been wrecked. Mrs Brooks said: 'There was blood on the carpet, on the bedding and in the bathroom. 'The bathroom door had been pulled off its hinges and a shower door had been broken. The bed and bedding were in disarray, and there were smashed lampshades. 'Miss Murray was crying.\u00a0There was also a hole in the bedroom wall.' Howie was arrested and initially gave a false name and date of birth and made no comment to police. Miss Murray was taken to hospital in Larbert, Stirlingshire, where a police surgeon found she had suffered 18 separate injuries. They included a bruising under the eyes and on the nose, damaged lips, scratches, and bruises to her jaw, both arms and both shoulders, her leg and thigh and her abdominal wall. According to the police surgeon, they were the result of 'moderate to severe force'. The pair were due to attend Hogmanay celebrations at Stirling Castle (pictured) on New Year's Eve last year . Howie has now admitted threatening violence, assaulting and injuring Miss Murray, causing damage to the room, and giving a false name to police. His defence agent James Moncrieff said today: 'Since this incident, Mr Howie has not consumed any alcohol. 'He is extremely remorseful and recognises that this is a very serious offence. 'The report makes clear that Mr Howie has had a troubled background.' Mr Moncrieff told the court that Howie and his girlfriend are planning on rekindling their relationship. He added: 'He accepts and she accepts that they are both going to have to address what happened on the night in question.' Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Howie: 'I have taken account of all that has been said on your behalf. 'I am told that your partner who is the complainer, appears to wish to continue a relationship with you, that is a factor that I have taken into account. 'These offences are examples of sustained violence.' Sheriff Robertson said that 'in relation to the circumstances of the offences' and despite the complainers desire to continue the relationship, there is 'no alternative to a custodial sentence.' He sentenced Howie to eight months in prison.", "reference": "Steven Howie, 28, attacked his girlfriend Karen Murray in a hotel bedroom .\nPunched and kicked her during the hour-long assault on New Year's Eve .\nStirling Sheriff Court heard bedroom was a 'bloodbath' following incident .\nHe was jailed for eight months but the couple plan to rekindle relationship .", "pred_summary": "Steven Howie, 28, punched, kicked and kneed her during a prolonged assault.\nHe was unable to get a signal to call police and officers only arrived after guests in another room dialled 999."}
{"article": "Payback: Scammer Rilwan Oshodi has been told he must repay nearly \u00a31million in fraudulent gains . A scammer who was the ringleader of a fraud gang has been ordered to repay nearly \u00a31million which he stole from the life savings of an innocent victim. Rilwan Oshodi bought Karen Budow's bank account details for just \u00a33,200 and spent her savings on cheeseburgers, bottles of champagne and top-of-the-range computers. He now claims he is so broke he can't even pay his lawyers - but a judge told him today that if he does not return his ill-gotten gains he will have to spend four more years in prison. Nigerian Oshodi, 31, bought Ms Budow's Santander details from an Egyptian hacker Tamer Abdulhamid, who had persuaded her to hand them over as part of a fishing scam. His girlfriend Annette Jabeth then posed as the victim and withdrew her \u00a31million life savings, which the gang spent in a three-day shopping splurge in the New Year sales in January 2012. Detectives said that their purchases had ranged from cheeseburgers to high-end computers and gold', while Oshodi spent \u00a31,134 on taxis and bought expensive gadgets including a MacBook and an iPhone. One picture of him even appears to show him holding a 'money sandwich', with Nigerian banknotes stashed between two slices of bread. He was jailed for eight years in 2013 after being convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to conceal criminal property. Appearing at Southwark Crown Court for a confiscation hearing today, Oshodi insisted he had not profited from the scam, and denied hiding money in overseas bank accounts. Money sandwich: This image appears to show Oshodi with Nigerian banknotes in between slices of bread . Champagne: But the scammer insists he does not have enough money to pay what he has been ordered to . He said: 'If I have hidden the goods, if I have got money how come I can't pay my solicitor, how come I can't rent a house, how come I was still broke, how come I am still broke, how come I am still poor? 'Wouldn't I get myself a new car, would I not buy myself some new clothes, Louis Vuitton or something?' But judge Stephen Robbins said: 'I reject what he said today... he was the main mover and architect of this fraud and he has hidden assets most likely outside this jurisdiction. 'He said he got nothing from it at all, no benefit directly.' Determining Oshodi to have made \u00a3940,820.34 in profit from the fraud, the judge ordered that he repay the total sum within six months or face a further four years in jail. Girlfriend: Annette Jabeth was also jailed in 2013 for her part in Oshodi's fraud .

{"article": "Jane Tipper had been walking her dog Molly when the eight-year-old chased a lamb over a cliff . A Border Terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall after chasing a spring lamb off the edge of \u00a0a cliff before spending three days stranded on a remote beach. Dog Molly had been on a walk with owner Jane Tipper and her daughter Hannah in Eype, Dorset, last week when the she fell over the cliff's edge along with the lamb. Molly survived a vertical drop of 100ft then rolled 150ft down a steep slope and coming to rest in gorse near the bottom. Her distraught owners managed to see that the eight-year-old had survived the drop, but had no way of getting down to the beach to get her. A team of ten coastguards arrived on the scene and a winchman was lowered down the cliff face but was unable to find her despite four hours of searching. Ms Tipper, who had been celebrating her 64th birthday, was forced to return home in nearby Charmouth without her beloved dog which she has had since she was a puppy. She contacted the website DogLost which arranged for missing posters to be put up in the area. Three days later, Molly was found in an exhaustive state after walking a mile further along the beach to an area popular with dog walkers. It is unclear what had happened, but luckily, she has come through her ordeal relatively unscathed - but there has been no sign of the lamb since the incident. Ms Tipper said: 'I was with my daughter, it was my birthday and we planned a short walk and lunch in a local cafe but we never got there. The border terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall, including a 100ft vertical drop, in Eype, Dorset, but her owner had no way of reaching her. Coastguards searched thoroughly but were unable to find her . 'Molly's usually very good, she doesn't chase animals. 'She fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope. I couldn't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop. 'The coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but couldn't see her. 'It's rocky there, there's thick patches of gorse and it's extremely dangerous. 'After a couple of hours they said they just couldn't spot her. They were very upset about it.' She added the incident left her 'completely numb'. 'We didn't stop searching at the end of the day,' she said. 'When I got home I phoned as many people as I could think of.' But fortunately, a female dog walker recognised Molly from the lost posters that had been put up in the area on Friday. After Ms Tipper put up missing dog posters, Molly was identified by a dog walker three days after going missing. Pictured right, the cliff face in Dorset where Molly fell . Ms Tipper added: 'The lady was walking her dogs when Molly followed her and sat next to her. She called me and we met up and fortunately it was Molly, I was worried it was going to be someone else's dog. 'Molly was very pleased to see me, especially when I got a gravy bone out of my pocket. 'She wasn't hurt or limping or anything, but she was shattered and spent the rest of the day asleep when we got home. 'I think it's really knocked the stuffing out of her.

{"article": "Property portfolio: Sol Campbell and his wife Fiona . The polls might have the parties neck-and-neck \u2013 but it looks like Sol Campbell is taking no chances. For the second time this year, the former England footballer is selling a multi-million pound property \u2013 leading to speculation he wants to dodge Labour\u2019s mansion tax if the party wins the election. An outspoken critic of the policy, Campbell has even threatened to leave the country if the tax on properties over \u00a32million comes into force. Earlier this year it was revealed he had taken the apparently bizarre decision to sell a \u00a320million London townhouse to a company owned by himself. Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. But it is possible the sale took place shortly before, meaning the increased charges would have been avoided. Now Campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of Chelsea. A former home of James Bond author Ian Fleming, the luxury penthouse by the Thames is on the market for \u00a36.75million. Campbell bought it in 2011 for \u00a34.25million after he reportedly staged a sit-in at an estate agents\u2019 in the hope of securing it for his family \u2013 his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell and their children Isabella and Ethan. It has since been extensively renovated by his wife, an interior designer and granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt. An advert for the property states: \u2018There are few properties within Chelsea that can offer the combination of views, spacious accommodation and exquisite finish.\u2019 Yet Campbell, 40, seems to be keen to rid himself of the flat before the election. Eye for detail: The living room inside Campbell's \u00a36.75million Chelsea flat boasts lavish furnishings . Nice touch: The former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender's kitchen is filled with marble . Sumptuous: Gilded mirrors line the hall in Campbell's luxurious flat, which is in an exclusive neighbourhood . Last year the former Arsenal and Tottenham defender blasted the proposed mansion tax, describing it as a \u2018cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well\u2019. He told The Times: \u2018With a mansion tax, you\u2019re taxing me for being prudent ... If Labour gets in, I\u2019d leave. I\u2019d have to say, \u201cSorry, I want to ship out\u201d.\u2019 Campbell has also said: \u2018I\u2019m not earning what I was earning five years ago.\u2019 Experts have said that properties worth between \u00a35million and \u00a310million could incur an annual charge of up to \u00a325,000 under a Labour government. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property commentator, said: \u2018Sellers like Sol Campbell face a financial dilemma: to take a certain hit now or await the potential tax bill that a Labour or Lib Dem Government may generate.\u2019 Since 2009 Campbell has also owned Grade II-listed Hallington Hall, an 18th Century mansion in Northumberland.

{"article": "It is the disease the medical community refuses to accept, and most experts claim is just a mental illness. Morgellons disease has been described by those who suffer from it as causing fatigue and memory loss, while also leading to large sores on the body which are constantly itching to the sensation of bugs or parasites crawling underneath the skin. From these sores they claim sprout colorful fibers that cannot be described and, according to one person, 'cannot be forensically identified as animal, vegetable or mineral.' That person is Joni Mitchell, who claims to have suffered from Morgellons for most of her life, and who has recently been hospitalized after she was found unconscious at her home. Mitchell, who suffered from polio as a child, remains in the hospital, but is said to be in 'good spirits.' Scroll down for video . Joni\u00a0Mitchell (above) has suffered from Morgellons disease throughout her life, and has recently dedicated herself to trying to get it accepted as a medical condition . Sufferers say they are constantly itching, and large sore develop on their skin from which colorful fibers (above) grow . Mitchell spoke of the disease in a 2010 interview with the Los Angeles Times, saying; 'I have this weird, incurable disease that seems like it's from outer space.' She went on to say; 'Fibers in a variety of colors protrude out of my skin like mushrooms after a rainstorm ... \u00a0Morgellons is a slow, unpredictable killer - a terrorist disease: it will blow up one of your organs, leaving you in bed for a year.' This is far different than the way many in the medical community describe the disease however, which, according to the Mayo Clinic, is incredibly rare and effects predominantly middle-aged white women. The Centers for Disease Control reports that the symptoms are very similar to those of mental illness, from the sensation of crawling and bugs and parasites to the concept of false beliefs. The CDC even conducted a study at one point, and found that most people who claim to suffer from the disease were likely just experiencing anxiety, depression or, in some cases, issues with substance abuse. Mitchell admitted to briefly having problems with addiction in a Reader's Digest interview, saying; 'I didn\u2019t get involved for years, and then I went on Rolling Thunder and they asked me how I wanted to be paid, and I ran away to join the circus: Clowns used to get paid in wine \u2013 pay me in cocaine because everybody was strung out on cocaine.' A 2012 paper published in a peer-reviewed medical journal\u00a0found that half of the 115 subjects tested positive for a prescription or illicit drug, among them;\u00a0amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, and even cocaine. Futhermore, most of the fibers collected from their skin were cotton, likely from clothing or bandages, and no parasites were detected in any of the individuals. The medical community believes Morgellons is likely a mental illness and that sufferers are anxious, depressed or even suffering from substance abuse (Mitchell above in 1996) Cindy Casey Holman, the director of the Charles E. Holman Morgellons Disease Foundation and herself a registered nurse takes issue with this study. 'A serious and often deadly systemic infection is present in Morgellons samples. Still patients are being prescribed antipsychotics while the infection goes undetected and untreated,' \u00a0she told CBS News. 'Clouding the picture is that some patients do exhibit psychiatric manifestations. But spirochetal infections, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, are well known to affect the central nervous system and cause psychiatric symptoms. Yet the infection is ignored while dermatologists offer dangerous antipsychotics as the only treatment.' Some individuals have said that taking antibiotics cured them of Morgellons, though some experts could bring that back to the idea of mental illness and claim it is simply a placebo effect. Researchers and experts meanwhile do accept that Morgellons exist, just not as an actual medical condition. Mitchell meanwhile has long been committed to having Morgellons recognized for what she believes it to be - an 'incurable disease.'", "reference": "Joni Mitchell was hospitalized on Tuesday after being found unconscious in her California home .\nMitchell has\u00a0suffered\u00a0from\u00a0Morgellons disease throughout her life, and has recently dedicated herself to trying to get it accepted as a medical condition .\nSufferers claim they feel the sensation of bugs or parasites constantly crawling\u00a0under\u00a0their skin and biting them .\nThey also say they are constantly itching, and large sore develop on their skin from which colorful fibers grow .\nThe medical community believes it is likely a mental illness and that sufferers are anxious, depressed or even suffering from substance abuse .\nMitchell, who has been a heavy smoker since she was 9-years-old and had polio as a child, has admitted she dealt with cocaine addiction in the 70s .\nIndividuals have said that taking antibiotics cured them of Morgellons, though some experts say it is simply a placebo effect .", "pred_summary": "Joni Mitchell, who suffered from polio as a child, remains in the hospital but is said to be in 'good spirits'"}

{"article": "(CNN)What would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $100, or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation? These are only two of the 100 challenges Chinese-born, American-based Jia Jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about \"100 Days of Rejection\", a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30, just weeks before his first child was born. After his tech start-up was declined investment, Jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on. This led to his writing his book called Rejection Proof, part self-help and part motivational/autobiography, which is being released this week. Famously, in 2012 on his third day of the project, Jiang asked Austin, Texas, Krispy Kreme manager (Jackie Braun) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the Olympic symbol. To his surprise, she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered. He shared his video and it went viral on Reddit. Before long, Jiang (and Braun) were invited on talk shows and Jiang was being asked to speak at events across the US. Jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew. That wasn't the goal of the project though. \"I'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears,\" explained Jiang. The project started out to help \"fix my own problems, and now I'm helping others fix theirs,\" he said. \"The fear of rejection really holds people back. I'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection.\" Jiang, who as a child dreamed of being Bill Gates and has been viewed 7 million times on YouTube, has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment. \"My goal is to turn rejection into opportunity. I always thought it was something to run away from, but if we can embrace it, we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle.\" 8 top tips in making rejection work for you: . 1 - The fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection. By putting ourselves out there, the world will usually open itself up to you. Though the world can seem cruel and cold, actually humans have a hard time saying no. So open yourself up, don't be afraid to ask for something. If you fail, remember it's not about you. 2 -  Rejection is more or less a numbers game. Sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes. If you talk to enough people, somebody will say yes to you. J.K. Rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 3 - You cannot use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Sometimes if you really want to change the world, getting rejection is a must. Rejection is a human interaction with two sides. It often says more about the rejector than the rejectee, and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit. 4 - Don't run away after a no. The most common thing we do when we're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you're hurt, angry and you lose confidence. But actually if we know how to handle it, we can often minimize the chance of rejection. Be confident, engaging, collaborate. I used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes. 5 - Ask why? When you get rejected you have to find out why. Then spend time to find solutions to solve that why. Sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for. Ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position. 6 - Set a number of how many no's you can take. In his book, Jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at Google. He tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job, she needs to prepare herself for how many no's she can take.  In the end, she was offered a job at Google. 7 - Be invincible. By the end of his project, Jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection. It was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded. It's like a muscle, I could become stronger and stronger. 8 - Stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion. People are who they are. A lot of people will reject you because of their mood, their education, their upbringing, and you can't change who they are. But you can stand confidently. Innate confidence comes across.

{"article": "Lawyers for jailed millionaire Robert Durst say he wants authorities to return more than $161,000 in cash taken after the real estate heir was arrested for murder. The attorneys say Durst, 72, got the money, now held by New Orleans police, legally and it is not needed for evidence or subject to forfeiture in any of his legal proceedings. Durst was arrested at the JW Marriott hotel in New Orleans on a Los Angeles County warrant that accused him of killing his friend Susan Berman in 2000 to keep her from talking to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. Scroll down for video . Murder suspect Robert Durst and his lawyers have asked for the return of $161,000 taken during his arrest in March. Above, the suspect leaves an arraignment in New Orleans on April 14 . Authorities who arrested Durst in mid-March found $44,000, marijuana and a revolver at his hotel room in New Orleans. They also found maps of Florida and Cuba, leading some to believe he was ready for a life on the run . His lawyers say the arrest in mid-March was timed to mesh with the finale of The Jinx, HBO's six-part series about Durst, his wife's disappearance, Berman's death, and the death and dismemberment of Durst's neighbor Morris Black in 2001. Authorities found more than $44,000 in Durst's hotel room, according to legal papers filed Wednesday. After his arrest, they intercepted a package containing personal items and $117,000 that was sent to the hotel for Everette Ward \u2014 the name Durst used to register there. During a hearing last month, a prosecutor said the package of $100 bills, a head-and-chest latex mask and a map folded to show Louisiana, Florida and Cuba were evidence that Durst was likely to flee if bond was set for him. Durst (right) was arrested for the murder of his friend and writer Susan Berman (left) in 2000, which some believe he may have committed to stop her from talking to authorities about the disappearance of his wife . Durst, the heir to a vast real estate fortune before becoming estranged from his family, is also connected to the 1982 disappearance of his first wife Kathy McCormack (left, with Durst) and the killing of Morris Black (right) They believe he had been gathering cash for life on the run. Durst is being held without bond on the California murder warrant and on state and federal weapons charges in Louisiana for the loaded revolver that was found in his hotel room. Investigators also found five ounces of marijuana in the room. Durst's attorneys also are making a second attempt to get the FBI agents and state trooper who arrested Durst to testify in state court. A statement filed with the court on Wednesday shows that a private investigator delivered subpoenas Monday to Agents Crystal Bender and William C. Williams and to Trooper Saunders Craine. Durst has been in custody since his mid-March arrest (pictured) and is facing federal and Louisiana state gun charges before extradition to California . The millionaire's defense team is being led by Houston litigator Dick DeGuerin (in cowboy hat) who says that his client wants to return to California to face the Berman murder charge . Federal prosecutors moved earlier subpoenas, which ordered them to testify before a Criminal District Court magistrate, to federal court. The new subpoenas call for them to testify before Judge Franz Zibilich, according to the statement. Durst's attorneys did not immediately respond to an email asking whether they expect prosecutors to move the new subpoenas, what Durst plans to do with the money if he gets it back, and the total of his legal bills so far.

{"article": "Darren Humphries, 37, was jailed for eight weeks for throwing chocolate mini eggs at his estranged wife . An angry husband who assaulted his estranged wife by pelting her in the face with chocolate mini eggs has been jailed for eight weeks. Darren Humphries, 37, began throwing Cadbury Mini Eggs at wife Claire, 31, after drunkenly losing his temper on March 3. Magistrates heard he flipped when his partner of 14 years refused to allow him into her home to see their two children. Humphries forced the door open and grabbed his wife by the jaw causing her to fall back into the house. He then picked up a packet of the chocolate treats - which had been bought for Easter - and began throwing individual eggs at her head. JPs were told Mrs Humphries managed to call police and her husband was arrested at the property in Windermere Drive, Worcester. On Monday he was jailed for eight weeks at Worcester Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to assault by beating and using violence to secure entry to a premise. Humphries, of no fixed abode, launched a tirade of abuse and expletives directed at magistrates when the sentence was announced. Sentencing, chair of the bench, Sue Dowty, said: 'There were lots of aggravating factors. 'The location of the offence, the fact it was domestic violence, you were in drink and it was carried out in front of your children.' The court heard in a separate incident Humphries damaged his estranged wife's car by throwing wheelie bins at the vehicle on February 23. Prosecutor Mark Soper said the defendant had launched the bins after Mrs Humphries had refused to let him sleep inside her Volkswagen Golf. He told the court: 'The couple have been separated since February 2014 after 14 years together - they have two children, a 10-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl. 'It seems Mr Humphries became mentally unwell and his wife decided the relationship should end. 'He had become very difficult to live with, using drugs and alcohol to self-medicate. Worcester Magistrates Court heard Humphries flipped when his partner of 14 years refused to allow him into her home to see their two children and began throwing Cadbury Mini Eggs after drunkenly losing his temper . 'This led to abusive and violent behaviour towards her and left her in fear of him. 'During the first incident he went to the home address. He was in drink and asked to be allowed to sleep in her car, but she did not allow him. 'He threw wheelie bins at the car and was arrested and charged with that offence. 'In the next incident he forced the door open and grabbed his wife by the jawbone causing her to fall into the house.' Mr Soper added: 'He was shouting at her and eventually released her, causing her further distress because she was in fear of him. 'Then he started throwing Cadbury Mini Eggs at her. 'She managed to call the police and the matters were admitted in interview.' Rob Macrory, defending, said: 'This behaviour is born totally out of frustration. 'He was driven by the emotion of wanting to see his children and he is generally so fed up in life. 'There are mental health difficulties but he does not believe he has a problem with alcohol. 'I would ask the court to consider that there were not extensive injuries to the victim and he only has a very short record.' Magistrates also imposed a restraining order preventing Humphries from contacting his estranged wife either 'directly or indirectly.' He was ordered to pay a victim surcharge of \u00a385.", "reference": "Darren Humphries threw mini eggs after drunkenly losing his temper .\nDefence said he was 'driven by the emotion of wanting to see his children'\nHe also threw a wheelie bin at estranged wife's car in a separate incident .\nHumphries hurled expletives at magistrates when told of his sentence .", "pred_summary": "Darren Humphries, 37, was jailed for eight weeks for throwing chocolate mini eggs at his estranged wife."}
{"article": "Jake Shaw, 21, died after falling from the upper floor of the Scout centre in the Swiss Alps where he had been volunteering as a climbing instructor . A popular  graduate fell to his death from a bedroom window in the Swiss Alps after playing drinking games, an inquest heard. Jake Shaw was just beginning his gap year - volunteering as a climbing instructor at Kandersteg International Scout Centre\u00a0- when the tragedy occurred last year. The 21-year-old had fallen\u00a025ft (8m) from the upper floor of the building in the early hours of August 1. He was airlifted to hospital in Bern suffering severe injuries but died nine days later. Lincoln Coroner's Court heard that shortly before his death, Jake had been celebrating the Swiss National Day with friends with drinking games called 'Power Hour' and 'Ring of Fire.' After consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at the centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a 'very drunk state'. It is then believed he lost his balance as he tried to open a bedroom window and toppled out of the window at the adventure camp in Interlaken, Switzerland. Today Lincolnshire Central assistant coroner Paul Smith, concluded that Jake's death was an accident. He said: 'The level of alcohol in his body was consistent with 11 standard drinks. 'It's the presumption that he was undeniably very drunk that evening - how that affected his balance is a matter of speculation. 'The most likely explanation is that in his state he took himself to bed, opened the window and perhaps overbalanced and fell.\u00a0'I'm satisfied that this was a tragic accident.' The court heard how in the game 'Power Hour', participants have to drink a shot of beer every minute for an hour and if completed two and a half litres of beer is consumed. A police report read out during the inquest, added: 'Examinations indicated that the August 1 celebrations were followed by a private party which Jake had attended. 'There were group games with drinks in the staff room. Jake had probably drank a large amount of mainly beer. After consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at Kandersteg International Scout Centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a 'very drunk state'. Shortly before his death, adventure-loving Jake had been celebrating the Swiss National Day with friends with drinking games called 'Power Hour' and 'Ring of Fire' 'At some time after 2.45am he came away in an alcoholised state without letting anyone know where he was going. 'It must be presumed he returned to his room. How the fall happened can't be established in any detail.' Jake, from Welton, Lincolnshire had graduated with a maths degree from Sheffield University and had just started a gap year at the time of his death.

LeBron James has been able to do just about anything he wants during his team's first three playoff games this season and that has apparently carried over to practice as well. James was at practice with his Cleveland Cavalier teammates on Saturday at the TD Garden in Boston before their game\u00a0against\u00a0the Celtics on Sunday afternoon. During a break in the action, James decided to practice his long-range shooting. Scroll down for video . LeBron James hit a\u00a0one-handed shot, which traveled almost the full length of the 94-foot court, on Saturday . After he wound up for the shot (left), James flicked it overhand (right) while his teammates watched him shoot . Just before the long distance shot went through the hoop, James could be heard saying: 'Give me my money' The NBA superstar grabbed a basketball and flicked it with relative ease at the hoop at the other end of the court. The one-handed shot, which traveled almost the entire length of the 94-foot court, dropped through the basket with an audible swish. Just before the full-court shot hit nothing but net, 'King James' said: 'Give me my money'. It's unclear who, if anyone James bet with, but James Jones did seem as if he was trying to disrupt the former MVP's concentration before the shot. Jones was also teammates with James when they both played for the Miami Heat. In 13 career postseason games in Boston, James is averaging about 29 points, nine rebounds, and six assists . After the video began to spread via social media, Dwight Howard of the Houston Rockets issued a response. In a clip the team posted, the center is seen swishing a one-handed shot of his own while wearing a yellow backpack. Instead of tossing the ball overhand, Howard used a motion that was one part underhand and one part sidearm to make his full-court shot find paydirt. Apparently Superman - Howard's nickname - is just as powerful as the King. After the video began to spread via social media, Dwight Howard of the Houston Rockets issued a response . The Cavs hold a 3-0 lead in their Eastern Conference first-round playoff series against the Celtics. In 13 career postseason games at TD Garden, James is averaging about 29 points, nine rebounds, and six assists. He has missed ten of the 13 three-point shots he has taken during the first three games of the series. Perhaps that is why he may have felt the need to bet with Jones, a deadly long-range shooter, about his prowess from long distance. If James and the Cavs make it to the NBA Finals, it will be his fifth straight appearance. He has won two championships but lost to the Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs.

Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay at the Sirenusa Condominium Resort on the  island of St. John. The family were airlifted to separate hospitals in Philadelphia suffering major respiratory trauma. Sean, 16, and Ryan, 14, were  in critical condition. Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay at the Sirenusa Condominium Resort on the island of St. John . James Maron, the family's lawyer, said the boys were in 'rough shape'. 'The family are all fighters,' he told WPBF News. 'They're fighting for everything right now. I understand it's a long recovery.' Maron said Esmond, who is an administrator of the private Tatnall School in Wilmington, is conscious but unable to move. Devine, a dentist, was treated and released from the hospital and is currently in occupational therapy. The Tatnall school, where Sean was a star lacrosse player, posted on their Facebook page that they had the Middle School students write get wall cards for Esmond and his family. 'The entire Tatnall community continues to direct its supportive energy toward the Esmonds and asks that everyone keep the family in their thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.' Tuition at the Tatnall school can range from $20,000 to $25,000 a year. Sean, 16, (pictured) and his 14-year-old brother Ryan remain in comas two weeks after being hospitalized . On Friday a spokesman from the US Environmental Protection agency said that the family may have fallen ill because of the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa. Elias Rodriguez said preliminary tests showed there was 'a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying'. Methyl Bromide, which is odorless, can be fatal or cause serious damage to the central nervous system and respiratory system, according to the EPA. It is acutely toxic, and only permitted to be used outdoors by certified professionals in the US. Rodriguez said the investigation is 'ongoing' and the agency is still on the island for testing. The family was staying at the\u00a0$875-a-night  Sirenusa Condominium Resort on St. John in the US Virgin Islands . 'We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling,' he said. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa Condominium Resort, said the unit where the family was staying was not treated with a pesticide, but rather the unit immediately below their suite.

{"article": "John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove to themselves at Liverpool on Monday night. The Magpies are in danger of being sucked into what had previously seemed an unlikely relegation battle given their alarming run of form. Amid accusations of the team 'playing with their flip-flops on', United have lost four on the spin - scoring just once - and Carver admits he does not know where their next point is coming from. It is unlikely to arrive at Anfield, a venue at which they last won in 1994. They were beaten 1-0 by North-East rivals Sunderland seven days ago \u2013 a performance Carver labelled 'embarrassing' \u2013 and there was a showdown meeting at the club's training ground this week in which the head coach let his feelings be known. John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove when they face Liverpool on Monday . Carver, though, is hoping that personal pride will kick in when they travel to Merseyside. 'Before they go out my message will be simple \u2013 'You have a point to prove, but prove it for yourself, not for me, not for anybody else, but for yourself. You owe it for yourself',' he said. 'The meeting we had on Wednesday was non-negotiable. We've had meetings in the past where I like a two-way dialogue. 'But I got a few things off my chest and it was probably the first time I've been Mr Nasty. 'After the meeting we trained and there was a great response. That hurt me a little bit because I wanted to see that on Sunday. But at least I got something from them.' Carver said this week that owner Mike Ashley has promised to invest in the squad this summer and a major overhaul is expected \u2013 out-of-contract players such as Jonas Gutierrez, Ryan Taylor and Sammy Ameobi will be released, while the likes of Yoan Gouffran, Cheick Tiote, Moussa Sissoko and Papiss Cisse are also expected to move on.

Carver, in fairness, is caught in the middle of what is a toxic relationship between supporters and the club's hierarchy. And the 50-year-old admits he has been on the receiving end of criticism from fans. 'I have to accept what people say.

{"article": "As America's elite crime investigators they are more used to tackling crime. But now FBI agents have been told they have to new enemy to battle -- calories. Expanding waistlines and lack of mobility for many agents has led to the introduction of a compulsory fitness tests. Those who fail will have the marks noted on their annual performance review and could lead to being moved from assignments that involve physical activity. Compulsory fitness tests have been introduced for all FBI agents following fears over expanding waistlines . FBI chief James Coney has introduced the tests amid fears his 135,000 agents are slipping behind when it comes to personal fitness. He said the force depends on its agents ability to 'run, fight and shoot'. Coney also said he wants the people to take one look at an agent think 'there goes a special agent of the FBI' rather than a derogatory remark about being overweight. Police in America are often parodied for their love of doughnuts and few forces have any weight restrictions. New recruits to the FBI have to take a physical test but for the last 16 years have not had to undergo any other fitness exam. As part of the annual test agents aged under 30 will have to run a mile in twelve and half minutes and sprint 300 metres in 59 seconds. They will also have to perform 24 push ups without stopping and 35 sit ups in a minute. Some agents have complained about the five minute break between the exercises as they struggle to catch their breath. FBI chief\u00a0James Coney\u00a0said the force depends on its agents' ability to 'run, fight and shoot' Older agents are given slightly longer times to perform the tests. A man in his 50s is allowed 15.14m for the mile run and 83 seconds for the sprint. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 12,000 female agents must also take the test. According to the New York Times, who obtained an internal memo from Coney about the fitness tests, few agents have rushed to meet the October deadline to complete the physical. In the Washington DC office only 75 out of the 800 agents have taken the test. The introduction of the tests comes as America is grappling with an obesity problem with a third of adults deemed obese or overweight. Figures from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention show that almost 80million adults are obese and the cause of death of more than 120,000 people a year. First Lady Michelle Obama has been at the forefront of tackling child obesity with a nationwide 'Let's Move' campaign urging children to get more exercise. The cost to the health care system treating people with illness caused by overeating such as strokes and heart attacks has been put at $98billion a year. The concern about the fitness of FBI agents began after the 9/11 terror attacks when the agency switched its main mission from catching criminals to fighting terrorism. Rather than taking part in arrests, often involving chasing criminals, they would spend hours sat behind a desk. Much of their work now involves cyber crime and intelligence gathering which mostly involves desk work and little exercise. 'You could see that health and fitness were not the priority it used to be,' said Zachary Lowe, the chief of physical instruction at the FBI HQ in Quantico, Virginia. Much of the FBI's work now involves cyber crime and intelligence gathering which mostly involves desk work and little exercise - hence the new drive to get fit . FBI chief Comey, who took over in 2013, discovered on touring field offices that morale was low. He also notes that many agents didn't look as if they would be able to pass the physical exam they had taken on joining the force. His new regime has led to many calling the agency the 'Fit Bureau of Investigation.' J Edgar Hoover, the famed first director of the FBI, had made fitness tests compulsory while he was in charge. Its current director said the lives of people they protect depend on agents fitness and health and they were symbols of what is 'right and good' about the US. He said: 'The lives of your colleagues and those you protect may well depend upon your ability to run, fight and shoot, no matter what job you hold. 'I want you to look like the squared away object of that reverence. I want the American people to be able to take one glance at you and think \"THERE is a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\".'", "reference": "Compulsory fitness tests introduced thanks to expanding waistlines .\nThose who fail could move from assignments  involving physical activity .\nFBI chief James Coney: Force depends on agents to 'run, fight and shoot'", "pred_summary": "FBI agents face compulsory fitness tests amid fears they are slipping behind.\nUnder 30s have to run a mile in 12 and half minutes and sprint 300 metres in 59 seconds.\nComes as America is grappling with an obesity problem with a third of adults deemed obese or overweight."}
{"article": "(CNN)A sexual harassment complaint has been filed against New Zealand Prime Minister John Key after a waitress complained about him repeatedly pulling her ponytail at an Auckland cafe. CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that the complaint was filed Thursday morning by Graham McCready, an accountant described in the New Zealand press as a \"serial litigant,\" who has previously launched private prosecutions against Key. McCready's complaint claimed that Key had breached a section of the country's Human Rights Act relating to sexual harassment, TVNZ reported. It reported that he was seeking considerable compensation for the waitress, 26-year-old Amanda Bailey, and \"if she does not want it I ask for the money be given to Women's Refuge.\" Key publicly apologized to Bailey, a waitress at his local cafe, for repeatedly tugging on her ponytail, after she complained about his behavior in a blog post. The post, published on New Zealand political website The Daily Blog, says that the odd behavior began during last year's election season. It was \"hardly an acceptable form of greeting,\" Bailey wrote. She wrote that while she didn't directly make her objections clear verbally, her body language \"screamed 'I don't like that.'\" \"As he approached me, he thought it would be fitting to raise his hands high and make scary, suspense sound effects, like the music from the movie 'Jaws',\" read the post. \"As he towered overhead I slunk down, cringing, whilst (Key's wife) Bronagh told him to 'Leave the poor girl alone.'\" The behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions, the post states. Eventually the cafe's manager made it clear to Key that his actions were unwelcome. Key, who regularly visits the Auckland cafe with his wife, told reporters that his behavior was in the context of \"a bit of banter,\" but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense. The blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own JK 2012 Pinot Noir wine by way of apology. \"We have lots of fun and games there, there's always lots of practical jokes and things. It's a very warm and friendly relationship,\" he told reporters in Los Angeles en route to ANZAC day commemorations in Gallipoli, Turkey. \"But if you look at it now, no. When I realized she took offense by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologized and said I was terribly sorry.\" Politicians and public figures also rounded on Key, with Green MP Metiria Turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate. \"A lot of New Zealanders know what it's like to feel as if you're not taken seriously in a job. As politicians, our job is to make people feel safe at work, not bullied,\" New Zealand media reported her as saying. \"It's a sign of how out of touch John Key has become when he can't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is, and when people are not comfortable with how he is behaving.\" Jackie Blue, head of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, echoed the sentiment. \"It's never OK to touch someone without their permission,\" TVNZ reported her as saying. \"There are no exceptions.\" Political analyst Bryce Edwards told the network that the \"strangeness factor\" of the accusation would haunt Key. \"A lot of people will be laughing at John Key, that's harder to recover from,\" he said in a segment. The National Council of Women of New Zealand, while accepting that Key was joking and did not mean to offend, criticized the premier. \"The fact that our Prime Minister has joined the list of people outed for sexism highlights how much sexism is a part of our culture. And it starts at the top,\" the organization's chief executive Sue McCabe wrote in an open letter. \"Up and down this country, day after day, people are touched without giving their consent. At one end of the scale, it is an unwelcome pull on a ponytail. At the other end, it's our shocking levels of violence against women.\"", "reference": "A sexual harassment complaint has been filed against PM John Key after a waitress complained about him repeatedly pulling her ponytail .\nKiwi Prime Minister accused of pulling a waitress' hair on several occasions despite her obvious discomfort .\nPM Key later apologized, but said that he was merely engaging in \"banter\"\nPoliticians and public figures have condemned his behavior .", "pred_summary": "New Zealand Prime Minister John Key is accused of sexual harassment by an accountant.\nKey publicly apologized to a waitress after she complained about him repeatedly pulling her ponytail.\nHe says it was in the context of \"a bit of banter\""}

The Holland striker\u2019s sharp performance at Craven Cottage suggests he will be in contention to start in Louis van Gaal\u2019s side for the visit of West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Van Persie missed seven matches after injuring his ankle in mid-February and has only just returned to the first-team picture, replacing Wayne Rooney for the final two minutes of United\u2019s 3-0 loss at Everton on Sunday. Robin van Persie lifts the ball over Magnus Norman to score his second, and Man United's fourth goal . Van Persie made an appearance for Manchester United Under 21s away at Fulham on Tuesday night . The Holland international opened the scoring as United took a commanding first-half lead at Craven Cottage .

Substitutes not used: O\u2019Hara, El Fitouri . Scorers: Van Persie 13, 80; Rothwell 20, 43 . Booked: Blackett . Referee: Ashvin Degnarain . The primary aim of this appearance was to get much-needed minutes under his belt but his two goals had the added effect of sending United four points clear at the top of the Under-21 Premier League table. Van Persie was undoubtedly the star attraction, but the team fielded by Warren Joyce also included Adnan Januzaj, Tyler Blackett, Anders Lindegaard and Andreas Pereira. And it didn\u2019t take long for the visitors to assert their authority against a Fulham side threatened by relegation from the top tier at this level. On 13 minutes, Van Persie controlled a Pereira through ball just inside the 18-yard box and slotted past Fulham goalkeeper Magnus Norman to open the scoring. It was two shortly afterwards when Januzaj found Joe Rothwell in behind the Fulham defence with a lovely through ball and United\u2019s No 7 was left with an easy finish.

Van Persie tangles with Fulham's Jonathan Buatu Mananga in the Under 21 Premier League match . Van Persie could have claimed his second five minutes later when he stretched to reach Januzaj\u2019s cross and saw his effort come back off the post. The contest was over two minutes before the break when Januzaj advanced down the right and cut the ball back for Rothwell to place the ball into the bottom corner. The Dutchman saw an effort deflect off Fulham captain Jonathan Buatu and against the crossbar in the second-half but he wouldn\u2019t be denied another goal. 10 minutes from time, he was found behind Fulham\u2019s back line again and added his second of the night with a dinked finish over Norman. It proved to be Van Persie\u2019s last act as he was replaced by James Weir before the restart. Fulham did claim a consolation in stoppage time when Stephen Humphreys headed home Luca de la Torre\u2019s cross.

{"article": "Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under David Cameron's Conservatives party, compared to just under nine per cent under Labour . Shares have performed nearly twice as well under Conservative governments than under Labour over the last 45 years, according to figures published today. Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under the Tories compared with just under 9 per cent under Labour and just over 9 per cent under the current Coalition. The figures, in an analysis for the Daily Mail by investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, are a further boost for David Cameron and George Osborne ahead of the general election on May 7. Ed Miliband is struggling to win over business men and women as well as investors who are worried about a Left-wing Labour government\u2019s attitudes to enterprise. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses this weekend showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government under Mr Miliband would be a \u2018catastrophe\u2019 for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors \u2013 including millions of workers saving for a pension \u2013 fare better under the Conservatives. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u2018The stock market has performed twice as well under a Conservative government as it has under Labour, according to performance statistics dating back to 1970.\u2019 The analysis shows that companies have also performed better under the Tories with profits up by an average of 11 per cent a year under the Conservatives and 6 per cent under Labour. Writing in the Daily Mail, Mr Khalaf said: \u2018Over the last 45 years there have been five Conservative governments, five Labour governments, and the current Coalition. \u2018Over that time the UK stock market has returned on average 16 per cent a year under Conservative rule, compared with 9 per cent under Labour. \u2018Markets can be capricious beasts in the short term, but on average this trend reflects the growth in UK company profits under the two parties.\u2019 However, he said events on the global stage \u2018are far more important to the UK stock market than the next resident of Number 10\u2019. He added: \u2018Looking back over the last 45 years, the waxing and waning of the stock market has been driven in large part by overseas influences, and is not commanded from Westminster. This makes sense when you consider how globalised most industries are.\u2019 Experts have warned that a hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing.

{"article": "Jakarta (CNN)An Indonesian court has rejected a bid by two Australian drug smugglers -- members of the \"Bali Nine\" -- to challenge their planned executions. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are awaiting death by firing squad on Indonesia's \"execution island\" for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot. A panel of three judges in the state administrative court in Jakarta on Monday confirmed an earlier ruling that it lacked the jurisdiction to hear challenges against President Joko Widodo's refusal to grant clemency. Lawyers for the pair had argued that Widodo had failed to individually consider their cases. One of the condemned men's lawyers, Leonard Aritonang, said he was disappointed with the rulings but would respect the court's decision. He said his team would file a further review, asking the Constitutional Court to explain Widodo's obligations regarding granting clemency. \"I'm hoping the government still respects... any ongoing proceedings,\" he said. Tony Spontana, a spokesman for the Indonesian attorney general's office, told CNN that the state administrative court's ruling was \"a relief.\" \"We had predicted it will be rejected because clemency is a prerogative right of the President, as head of the government, not an object of a suit at the administrative court,\" he said in a message. \"With this decision, it's a step closer towards the scheduled execution.\" Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with Indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths. Indonesia has long taken a hard line on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, Widodo has made it clear he intends to be tough on those found guilty of such crimes. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in January, he said there would be \"no compromise\" on drug dealers. \"Indonesia is in a drug emergency, so we need to have something that's firm,\" said Widodo. \"They can ask for amnesty from the President. ... But I'm telling you there will be no amnesty for drug dealers.\" In December, six prisoners convicted of drug offenses were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam. Chan and Sukumaran have been jailed since April 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. The Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Chan, 31, was called the ringleader of the plot, while Sukumaran was described as Chan's collaborator. Seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences. Police caught four people at the Denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies. Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney; he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot. Opinion: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said that their rehabilitation is genuine. Australians have shown public support for the men, with politicians and members of the public turning out for a dawn vigil to demonstrate opposition to the planned executions.

{"article": "David Miscavige, the controversial leader of the Church of Scientology, allegedly had his apostate father followed for 18 months for fear he might reveal damaging information about the inner workings of the secretive organization. According to police records obtained by the Los Angeles Times, the church paid a father-son team of detectives $10,000 a week to track Ron Miscavige's every move, review his electronic correspondence and eavesdrop on his conversations. The claims, which the Church of Scientology has categorically denied through its attorneys, come just weeks after the premiere of the explosive HBO documentary Going Clear, where former members of the church accused David Miscavige and his associates of systemic harassment, abuse and blackmail. Scroll down for video . Explosive claims: Private investigator Dwayne Powell reportedly told Wisconsin police in 2013 that he was hired by David Miscavige (left), the head of the Church of Scientology, to spy on his elderly father, Ronald (right) after he'd left the church . Secretive: The elder Miscavige was allegedly followed by a father-son pair of detectives for 18 months for fear he might reveal damaging information about the inner workings of the church . Ronald Miscavige, 79, had recently left the Church of Scientology, which has been under the leadership of his 54-year-old son since 1986. The allegations of surveillance targeting the renegade scientologist originally came to light two years ago following the arrest of Florida-based private investigator Dwayne Powell. Powell was stopped in a Milwaukee suburb in July 2013 carrying two rifles, four handguns, a makeshift silencer, a knife and a cache of ammunition. Adding fuel to the fire: The claims come just weeks after the premiere of the explosive HBO documentary Going Clear . According to arrest documents, the private eye\u2019s rented Ford Edge also contained binoculars, a GPS device and a stun gun. During questioning, the sleuth reportedly told police that he was hired by the Church of Scientology through a Florida firm to follow Ronald Miscavige on a full-time basis. Powell reportedly recounted to police how one time he was tailing Mr Miscavige when he witnessed the elderly man clasp his chest and slump over while placing groceries in his car. Thinking that Miscavige was having a heart attack, the private investigator called his supervisor and asked for further instructions. Minutes later, he got a call from David Miscavige himself, according to the records, who told Powell that 'if it was Ron's time to die, to let him die and not intervene in any way.' The elder Miscavige eventually came to and drove off. Last year, Dwayne Powell was charged with a single count of possession of an illegal silencer, but the indictment against him was later dismissed . In a statement to the Times, David Miscavige's personal attorney, Michael Lee Hertzberg, vehemently denied any connection between Powell and his client. \u2018Please be advised that Mr. Miscavige does not know Mr. Powell, has never heard of Mr. Powell, has never met Mr. Powell, has never spoken to Mr. Powell, never hired Mr. Powell and never directed any investigations by Mr. Powell,\u2019 the lawyer told the paper. An attorney for the church also commented on the allegations, calling them 'blatantly false.' During an interview with police in West Allis, Wisconsin, Dwayne Powell reportedly said that his job was to keep tabs on Ronald Miscavige and his wife, Becky, to make sure they do not divulge any details about Church of Scientology activities. Powell reported directly to a Florida firm specializing in private investigations and worked the case with his 21-year-old son. Miscavige, chairman of the board of Religious Technology Center (pictured left and right with Tom Cruise), allegedly prohibited the private investigator from helping his  father during a medical emergency . The duo's surveillance activities allegedly included sifting though Ronald Miscavige's garbage, photographing him, tailing him using a tracking device they had planted on his car and listening to his conversations in public places. Police records indicate that when Miscavige would go to a local library to check his email, Powell or his son would stand behind his back and photograph the computer screen. According to a police report, as recently as last September Ron Miscavige and his wife said they believed they were being watched by his son\u2019s henchmen. Daniel Powell reportedly has corroborated many of his father's statements in interviews with police.", "reference": "Wisconsin\u00a0police arrested private\u00a0investigator\u00a0Dwayne Powell in 2013 who claimed he\u00a0was hired by Church of Scientology to spy on Ron Miscavige .\nDavid Miscavige's 79-year-old father had left the church a couple of years ago .\nPowell reportedly told police his job was to track Miscavige's movements, read his emails and listen in on his conversations .\nDavid Miscavige allegedly prohibited the private investigator from helping his father during a medical emergency .\nChurch of Scientology and David Miscavige's attorneys vehemently denied Powell's claims .", "pred_summary": "Ronald Miscavige, 79, had recently left the Church of Scientology.\nScientology allegedly paid a father-son team of detectives $10,000 a week to track him."}

A gambling addict stole more than \u00a322,000 from her grandmother's 98-year-old partner to blow on her scratchcard habit, a court heard. Marylin Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's pin number,\u00a0cheque books and bank cards to manage his financial affairs after he went into\u00a0care at Cedar House, Rothley. But the court heard that she abused that trust and began withdrawing up to \u00a3200 a day to feed her gambling habit. The 64-year-old admitted stealing \u00a322,650 from the elderly victim but was ordered to pay back just \u00a31,350 - which was all that remained of the stolen funds. The theft was  discovered after the deputy manager of the care home became suspicious that Stoneman's step-grandfather, Douglas Woodrow, was receiving a number of letters from the bank. On August 19, he asked a member of staff to open one of the letters which indicated the victim had no money left in his accounts. The care home alerted Lloyds Bank in Loughborough, where they noticed unauthorised cash\u00a0withdrawals had taken place from July 2013 and the police were contacted. Leicester Crown Court heard that Stoneman was 'solely responsible' and 'had been waiting for\u00a0the police.' She had also taken an overdose as a result, the court heard. The devastated victim, who had gone into the care home in Leicestershire after a number of falls, said he felt angry and betrayed by Stoneman. In a statement read to the court, Mr Woodrow said:\u00a0'She has stole money from my bank account which is my life savings. It is what I have paid for my care. 'I am so angry she has taken everything. I am angry at everyone. It has\u00a0really hurt me. 'I have worked hard all my life to be left with nothing.\u00a0'I can't trust anyone.' Defending Stoneman, who has no previous convictions, Vasanti Vaitha said:\u00a0'It was a relief when the police knocked on the door. She had been waiting\u00a0for it for a long time.

Judge Michael Fowler said: 'I know you understand the meanness and\u00a0seriousness of what you have done. 'It is more serious that Mr Woodrow trusted you.

{"article": "Rafa Benitez is what he is; an excellent cup manager. He proved this yet again on Thursday, when his Napoli side blitzed past Europa League favourites Wolfsburg by four goals to one on the Germans' home turf. But despite managing some of the continent's most established clubs since leaving Valencia just over a decade ago - Liverpool, Inter, Chelsea (albeit on an interim basis) and Napoli - he has amassed a grand total of zero league titles. Benitez famously guided Liverpool to the Champions League in 2005 as he enjoyed cup successes . Benitez remains popular at Anfield, but when he left there were few regrets over his departure . Donovan Chandler is a Liverpool fan writer on 90min.com . At Anfield, we will be eternally grateful for the Champions League trophy he delivered in 2005, in spite of possessing what was, on paper at least, our worst accumulation of players in recent history. Djimi Traore, Antonio Nunez, Milan Baros and Igor Biscan - cult hero that he was - were all part of that unfathomably successful squad. All four were dispensed of either that summer or the one that followed. Two years after Instanbul, Benitez was (almost) at it again with a side that better resembled the one he would have wanted, though it wasn't quite good enough to overcome an improved AC Milan side on this occasion. For all the Spaniard's successes, he also brought in the hapless Djimi Traore and Czech forward Milan Baros . And although we ran Manchester United a close second two seasons after that, we actually ended up further away from the Premier League title than we had been in a number of years during his final campaign (2009-10) - a failure that signalled the end to an Anfield tenure that also yielded our last FA Cup. In between, he lumbered us with the Josemi's, Albert Riera's and Phillipp Degen's of this world; none of us had many regrets over his departure - except, of course, that it was the catalyst for our introduction to Roy Hodgson. Benitez won the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006 on penalties against West Ham . With Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard playing well together, Benitez got close to the title, but never won it . And for all his moments, I fully believe we are on the right track again under Brendan Rodgers, even if we can't quite clutch that final Champions League spot this season - or miss out on the FA Cup. That's why, if Rafa returns to England again in the summer - as is being speculated due to Napoli's Serie A shortcomings this season - it will receive little more than a shrug from large sections of the Kop. His league failings mean he is unlikely to be sworn in at any of our top-four rivals, unless Manchester City need someone to keep the seat warm for their dream conquest Pep Guardiola. Liverpool's failure in the Premier League means that Benitez will always be remembered as a cup specialist . As far as my uneducated eyes can see, someone like West Ham would be the best place for your money, if you're that way inclined. A sudden influx of largely Spanish-based signings would bring (mostly temporary) excitement and they'd probably do well in the cups - enough to banish memories of the Big Sam years at least. That's where Rafa excels; Europa League success at Stamford Bridge and triumph in the Coppa Italia last term are further testament to this. But a threat to us and where we want to be? It would only be a result of our own self-destruction. Good luck, Rafa. And thanks for the memories.", "reference": "Rafa Benitez won the Champions League and FA Cup with Liverpool .\nBut the Spaniard is little more than a cup manager, lacking league titles .\nLiverpool fans are grateful to Benitez for his successes .\nBut the Kop faithful won't mind him coming back to England with new club .", "pred_summary": "Napoli manager Rafa Benitez guides his side to a 4-0 win over Wolfsburg on Thursday.\nThe Spaniard has managed Liverpool, Inter, Chelsea and Napoli but never won a league title.\nLiverpool lost the Champions League to AC Milan in 2005, but won the FA Cup in 2006.\nChandler: \"Good luck, Rafa.

She was later picked up by a boater. Police have yet to find Viafore's body. According to a criminal complaint unveiled Thursday afternoon, prosecutors allege that Graswald intentionally caused Viafore's death. The complaint states that rough waters combined with strong winds caused Viafore\u2019s kayak to overturn. The man was not wearing a life jacket at the time and was unable to turn the capsized boat right-side up. Authorities did not specify what led them to conclude that Graswald was responsible for her fiance's death, only saying that she had made statements implicating herself in the crime. She was arraigned Thursday and ordered held without bail at the Orange County Jail with no bail. She is due back in court May 5. In the days leading up to her arrest, Graswald had been active on her Facebook page, sharing cellphone videos of her cat and uploading a dozen romantic photos of her and Viafore from their time together. As recently as Tuesday, she shared a picture of the happy couple at a lakeside cabin, accompanied by the caption: 'I miss you, my love...'

The couple, who had been together for many years, were kayaking on the Hudson River between Plum Point and Bannerman\u2019s Island at around 7.30pm April 19 when Viafore's vessel overturned, sending him into the frigid water.

The 35-year-old was taken to hospital and treated for hypothermia but her fiance has not been found. Viafore's friend Wes Gottlock said he saw them out on the water, but did not discover there was a search underway until later on that evening.

{"article": "Peter Scudamore rode an incredible 1,678 winners but has seen his achievements dwarfed by AP McCoy. Here, he identifies what he believes are the 10 finest achievements of Saturday's retiring champion. 1 RIDING HIS 4,000th WINNER AT TOWCESTER ON NOVEMBER 7, 2013 . He has won virtually every big race in the calendar but McCoy\u2019s greatest feat has to be the immense tally of winners he has ridden. To put his numbers into perspective, in the all-time list of successful jockeys, great rival Richard Johnson is closest to him and the gap is around 1,500 winners. Tony McCoy celebrating after he won his 4,000th race on board Mountain Tune at Wetherby in 2013 . 2 HIS 20 STRAIGHT JUMP JOCKEY TITLES . If you like your champions dominant, you have to love McCoy. No modern sportsman can match his reign. He outstrips 16-time darts world champion Phil Taylor by almost 200 weeks, with a staggering 1,040 weeks at the top. That compares to 364 for Formula One\u2019s Michael Schumacher and 302 for tennis ace Roger Federer. 3 WINNING THE 1994-95 CONDITIONAL JOCKEYS CHAMPIONSHIP . McCoy hit the ground running on his arrival in Britain from Ireland, landing the apprentice title for jumps jockeys with a record 74 wins. Not surprisingly, it is another McCoy record which still stands. 4 RECORD 290 WINNERS IN A SEASON (2001-02) The 300-winner season McCoy craved proved too much even for him but he got close with 289 in Britain and one abroad. His feat outstripped the European record of German Peter Schiergen (271 in 1995) and Sir Gordon Richards\u2019 best of 269 in 1947. 5 WINNING BBC SPORTS PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR IN 2010 . Not to be underestimated. Frankie Dettori and Lester Piggott are household names but neither of those great jockeys won this prestigious title. McCoy\u2019s prodigious achievements have transcended racing\u2019s usual boundaries and his peerless career has gained the respect it deserves. McCoy stands proud with his Sport Personality of the Year Award in Birmingham in 2010 . 6 DON\u2019T PUSH IT\u2019S 2010 GRAND NATIONAL WIN . Picking out even a handful of McCoy\u2019s best wins is an exercise in subjective futility. We all have our favourites but Don\u2019t Push It\u2019s victory at Aintree was arguably the most significant on the greatest stage. Plenty of top jockeys have never had a sniff of the Grand National winner\u2019s enclosure. McCoy celebrates aboard Grand National winner Don't Push It at Aintree racecourse in 2013 . 7 WORTH HIS WEIGHT . Unbelievably, given the lengths to which he has gone to control his weight and boil himself down, McCoy has never had to put up overweight (carry more than his mount was allotted). It is another example of his extraordinary self control. 8 BREAKING MY FASTEST TIME TO 100 WINNERS IN A SEASON . I never thought my fastest-to-100-wins record would stand forever but in November 1996 McCoy thrashed my best by 30 days. A season later and he beat his own record by 16 days. This season he set a new best for a fastest ton on August 21, 116 days into the season. McCoy achieved the fastest ever century of jumping winners at Warwick in 1996 on board Class of 92 . 9 NOT JUST THE WIDTH, FEEL THE QUALITY . He has not had the consistent big-race firepower of compatriot Ruby Walsh but 31 winners at the Cheltenham Festival is still an amazing tally for McCoy and includes three Champion Hurdles and two Gold Cups. To put that in perspective, John Francome only had 10 Festival wins and Richard Dunwoody 18, while I had 13. In all, he rode 196 wins at Cheltenham. 10 THE WORCESTER SOURCE . McCoy has ridden more winners at Worcester \u2014 298 from 1,089 rides \u2014 than at any course in Britain and the venue, while not individually significant, is symbolic. It shows what a force of energy he has been at the mundane weekly meetings. Never has his motivation dropped, no matter how small the stage. It is a trait which set him apart.

{"article": "A trespasser carrying a suspicious package jumped over the White House railings last night - the latest in a string of embarrassing security breaches to hit the US capital. The intruder was arrested after climbing into the grounds of the President's home at 10.25pm. Brian Leary of the United States Secret Service - the federal agency in charge of protecting the President - said the unnamed person was in custody in Washington DC and charges were pending. He added that the intruder, whose gender or age has not been released,\u00a0had been 'immediately' apprehended by officers in the uniformed division of the Secret Service. Scroll down for video . A member of the Secret Service uniformed division and his K-9 dog patrol the perimeter of the White House . The package was examined and 'deemed to be harmless', according to a report by CNN. It is not known what it contained or why the fence was climbed. The trespasser entered the south side of grounds, which face the National Mall. Last September, a knife-wielding man managed to scale the fence on the north side and get into White House itself via an unlocked door. That incident prompted a review of the building's security. Just last week US officials announced that temporary steel spikes may be put on the tips of the railings. The 8ft-tall fence  is due to be replaced in the longer term with a permanent, more secure barrier, the details of which are still under discussion. Security fears: The 8ft-tall railings surrounding the President's residence are set to be replaced . Security in Washington DC in general has been the focus of much attention in recent months. Last Wednesday an illicit gyrocopter was able to land on the west lawn of the US Capitol. Its pilot Doug Hughes, a Florida mail worker, said he was protesting against the way political campaigns are funded.

{"article": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that intercepted phone calls prove the US helped Chechen Islamic insurgents wage war against Russia . Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that intercepted phone calls prove the US helped Chechen Islamic insurgents wage war against Russia. In a documentary aired today  on state-owned Rossiya-1 TV channel, he said phone records from the early 2000s show direct contact between North Caucasus separatists and US secret services. 'At one point our secret services simply detected direct contacts between militants from the North Caucasus and representatives of the United States secret services in Azerbaijan,' Putin said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question. But he claimed a few days later the heads of Russia's FSB received a letter from their American counterparts, which said they had the right to support opposition forces in Russia. 'Someone over there, especially the West's intelligence services, obviously thought that if they act to destabilize their main geopolitical rival, which, as we now understand, in their eyes has always been Russia, it would be good for them. It turned out, it wasn't,' Putin said. He said he had warned the West about the possible dangers of supporting terrorists. Following a disastrous war in the 1990s, Russia fought Islamic insurgents in Chechnya and neighboring regions in the volatile North Caucasus. 'They were actually helping them, even with transportation,' Putin said. The documentary 'The President' showed Putin being interviewed at the Kremlin in the dimly-lit St. Alexander's Hall. He even defended the annexation of Crimea as a response to the will of the people, saying it righted a historical injustice. The annexation of the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 provoked the worst crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Putin said he had no regrets. 'It's not because Crimea has a strategic importance in the Black Sea region. It's because this has elements of historical justice. I believe we did the right thing and I don't regret anything,' he said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question . Putin also said sanctions imposed by the West after the annexation were aimed at halting Russia's progress as a global power. Putin condemned punitive sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union. 'We have witnessed such attempts during Russia's entire history, dating back to tsarist times. This attempt to deter Russia, this policy, has been known for a long time, for centuries. There is nothing new,' he was reported as saying. Putin also expressed his fears that the West wishes Russia harm as he recalled how some world leaders told him they would not mind Russia's possible disintegration. 'My counterparts, a lot of presidents and prime ministers told me later on that they had decided for themselves by then that Russia would cease to exist in its current form,' he said. 'The only question was when it happens and what consequences would be.'", "reference": "Putin said calls show contact between insurgents and US secret services .\nHe claimed US helped Chechen extremists wage war against Russia .\nPresident said\u00a0George Bush promised to 'kick the ass' of officers involved .\nHe made claims in documentary aired today on state-owned Russian TV .", "pred_summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin says intercepted phone calls prove the US helped Chechen Islamic insurgents wage war against Russia.\nPutin said he raised the issue with then-U.S. President George W.

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Friday, it was revealed that Zaslav was compensated an unbelievable $156.1million last year.

It is a remarkable boost from the $33million he received in 2013, with $22.5million of that also coming from stock awards. The amount seems to be deserved as well, as under Zaslav's guidance, the company's market cap has grown from $5billion in 2007 to $20billion today. As for his base salary, that was $3million, where it will stay for the length of his contract, and he can no receive a cash bonus greater than $6.6million until the last two years of his new contract, when that amount goes to $9million.

Redstone, who heads up CBS and Viacomn, took home $93.4million, while Moonves, the CEO of CBS, took home $66.9million. 'This contract rewards Mr. Zaslav for the value he has created and the continued strategic direction he provides and requires sustained performance over time for that award to have value,' the filing states. 'At the end of his contract, Mr. Zaslav will own a substantial amount of equity of Discovery, which reinforces his alignment with our shareholders and encourages long-term ownership of our stock.' This amount is far, far greater than the $93million CBS chairman Sumner Redstone (left) made in 2013 and the $67m Les Moonves (right) made .

{"article": "Marcus Copeland, 44, admitted one count of fraud at Caernarfon Crown Court. He was told he faces jail . A top mortgage broker who bragged that he \u2018spared no expense\u2019 to build his dream home is facing jail after conning a bank into giving him the money for it. Marcus Copeland, 44, splashed out almost \u00a31million to complete the six- bedroomed eco house. He sourced specialist Scottish stone and installed the latest environmentally friendly technologies to make the house in Cwm Dyserth, near St Asaph, North Wales, one of the most \u2018green\u2019 new builds in the country. But yesterday it emerged that the married father-of-two\u2019s dream had become a nightmare, after he admitted lying on mortgage forms to secure more than \u00a3800,000 for the property. At Caernarfon Crown Court the former journalist, who was once named best mortgage broker in the Midlands and Wales, admitted two counts of fraud by lying to Abbey National about the profitability of his business to secure the \u00a3847,000 loan in March 2007. At an earlier hearing, he also pleaded guilty to five charges of deception after he used his position to inflate the salaries of five of his clients and help them obtain mortgages totalling \u00a3686,000. Jonathan Austin, defending, said Copeland maintained that all the customers knew he had boosted their wages when making the applications. The barrister added that none of the loans had ever been defaulted upon. \u2018All these mortgages proved to be affordable,\u2019 the barrister said. \u2018The obligations were met.\u2019 Recorder Gregory Bull QC bailed Copeland, of Deganwy, Llandudno, for sentencing later this year. But he went on to warn him: \u2018You are not to read anything into the likely sentence. Imprisonment remains an option.\u2019 In November 2010 Copeland\u2019s home was featured in an article for Homebuilding and Renovating magazine and described as the \u2018quintessential self-build story \u2013 huge ambition matched by a hopelessly stretched budget, spiralling costs and immense stress.\u2019 He and his wife Yvonne, 44, spent a year trying to persuade a farmer to sell them an elevated plot of land in the picturesque village in Denbighshire for \u00a3250,000, before spending another \u00a3750,000 on the build. Spread out over three storeys, the house features two double garages, a home office, an open-plan kitchen, a dining and sitting area, a TV room terrace and a roof garden, all cut into a hillside overlooking the rolling Welsh countryside. Talking about the project, Copeland told the magazine: \u2018If I was to do it again, I\u2019d control my spending. I fell in love with a stone from Scotland that I wanted for the exterior walls. \u2018It cost a fortune and I\u2019m not sure you can tell the difference compared with cheaper options. But this was our dream home, so I spared no expense.\u2019 The couple sold the house in September 2012 for \u00a3925,000 but, following Copeland\u2019s guilty plea, are now facing having to pay back any profit they have made via the Proceeds of Crime Act.

{"article": "A newly-released video has highlighted the shocking - and arguably discriminatory - price differences between near-identical products and everyday services offered to women and men, . The clip, which was created by\u00a0HLN's The Daily Share,\u00a0illustrates the prevalence of this 'women's tax' to shocking affect by directly comparinga variety of different products and services aimed at men and women and then revealing the price differences. Even more disappointing is that this practice of 'invisible tax' is not only found almost everywhere, but it is entirely legal in almost every state in the US - even when the products or services are exactly the same for both genders. Scroll down for video . That price could use a shave: The Daily Share found that the differences between these razors of the same brand differed by more than a dollar between the men's and women's versions . Compounded with the fact that women make, on average,\u00a078 cents on the dollar to men, the facts prove than gender bias is more than just offensive, it's also very expensive. For example, a\u00a0Schick\u2019s Hydro 5 men\u2019s razor was picked up for\u00a0$8.56, but the women's version - the\u00a0Schick Hydro Silk - was, for some reason, given more than a one dollar mark-up, and was priced at\u00a0$9.97. An even greater disparity was found in the perfume aisle, where\u00a0Narciso Rodriguez Eau de Toilettes For Him and For Her respectively cost $87 and $106.60. Meanwhile, a pair of Neutrogena anti-aging creams with the exact same ingredients were also found to inexplicably cost women $1.07 more per ounce - despite the skincare brand admitting that the two products were essentially the exact same product encased in different packaging. One of the few equal prices found by the video's creators was, of course, on a unisex American Apparel shirt. But when a man and a woman each dropped off the exact same shirt to get dry-cleaned, the woman was charged an extra 75 cents - and the tag even labelled the laundered item as a 'Lady Shirt'. Something smells fishy: There is almost a ful 20 dollar difference between the his and hers versions of this brand of cologne . Seriously? The presenters claim that the exact same shirt dropped off at a dry cleaners cost more to clean when a woman brought it in . The two presenters do point out that conditions are getting slightly better; medical insurance used to cost women in America $1 billion more each year before ObamaCare outlawed the practice of gender-biased pricing discrimination. However, in terms of everyday gender-taxing across the country, a 1995 report\u00a0found that 'gender tax' cost women approximately $1,351 annually - a number which doesn't show any signs of decreasing any time soon. And while the shocking statistics in the caused California to put a state-wide ban on the practice in 1996, with New York City also opting to impose a similar ban on gender pricing, the rest of the US continues to allow the practice. Even something as basic as long-term care insurance costs women 13 per cent more, a hike they apparently base on the fact that women have longer life-spans - in the same way that they raise rates on smokers.

{"article": "Samsung famously poked fun at Apple when it emerged its iPhone 6 Plus could bend out of shape in people's pockets. But now the South Korean firm is facing a 'bendgate' controversy of its own after a video emerged claiming to show a similar flaw on the Galaxy S6 Edge. The company has now responded with its own video, demonstrating a three-point bend test on both its Galaxy S6 models. Scroll down for video . A video has emerged showing Galaxy S6 Edge bending and shattering under 110lbs (50kg) of pressure. The video was released by\u00a0third-party warranty firm SquareTrade, and has since been criticised by Samsung . 'We are confident that all our smartphones are not bendable under daily usage,' the company said in a statement. The comments and video were posted in response to findings from third-party warranty firm SquareTrade, which publicised that the Galaxy S6 Edge can bend and shatter under 110lbs (50kg) of pressure. It also tested the HTC One M9 both deformed and broke at 120lbs (54kg). 'Bendability may be good in the yoga studio, but it is not what you want in a mobile device,' said Jessica Hoffman, vice president of global communications for SquareTrade. 'Last fall's Bendgate caught many by surprise, but as manufacturers strive for larger screens on thinner devices, they can be more susceptible to bending or snapping. 'SquareTrade Labs' tests reveal that while the iPhone 6 Plus bends, the Galaxy S6 edge cracks under pressure. Samsung claims the tests conducted by SquareTrade was unfair as 110lbs (50kg) of pressure 'rarely occurs under normal circumstances.' 'The video assumes a very specific condition - 110lbf (50kgf),' the company said. The teardown shows, from the front, the screen, logic board holder, battery, logic board with processor, camera, rear case and antenna. It is a fascinating view of exactly what goes into a modern smartphone - and how Samsung does business. The Chipworks site has posted this amazing image revealing the internals of the firm's Galaxy S6, which goes on sale on April 10th. The internals reveal Samsung used more of its own chips to power the new Galaxy S6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor S5, according to an early teardown report, in a blow to U.S. chip supplier Qualcomm. Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said. Samsung is counting on its new flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014. Strong sales of system chips such as its Exynos processor could also help boost earnings, analysts and investors say. The Galaxy S6 also comes with Samsung's Shannon modem chip, U.S. phone carrierAT&T said on its website. 'The normal force that generated when a person presses the back pocket is approximately 66lbf (30kgf). 'Our internal test results indicate that the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge are not bendable even under 79lbf (32kgf), which is equivalent to putting pressure to snap a bundle of five pencils at once.' Samsung added that the test done by SquareTrade 'does not show the strength of the back side.' It has now asked SquareTrade to do the test again on both the front and back sides of the device. Apple had to go to similar lengths during its own 'Bendgate' crisis, by allowing reporters into its labs to showcase iPhone 6 Plus durability tests. Samsung claims the tests conducted by SquareTrade was unfair as 110lbs (50kg) of pressure 'rarely occurs under normal circumstances.' Pictured is the smartphone after the test was conducted .

{"article": "An adaptor that allows colour blind people to enjoy TV without a loss of detail is seeking funding on Kickstarter. Called Eye2TV, it adjusts colours in the image so that shows look 'normal', even if features colours such as red and green that would otherwise not be visible. And the subtle effect is such that someone with normal vision will barely notice any change in the picture, so people can easily watch TV together. Scroll down for video . Norwich scientists have developed an adaptor for colour blindness. Eye2TV can be plugged into any HDMI port on a TV or a computer monitor (shown in illustration). A remote control or app then adjusts the colour adjustment. It allows colour blind people to watch shows they otherwise couldn't . The team from the University of East Anglia in Norwich is\u00a0seeking \u00a3100,000 ($150,000) of funding to get their project of the ground. At the moment you can buy a single adaptor with a Bluetooth remote control for \u00a350 ($75), with shipping expected in May 2016. The device uses a patented Eyeteq algorithm to automatically adjust the picture, with a variety of settings available until optimal picture quality is found. The video is enhanced on a frame-by-frame basis through Spectral Edge's patented Eyeteq image enhancement technology, offering a dramatically improved viewing experience. The picture quality can be adjusted via remote control to suit the unique colour-vision of the individual viewer. To make the effect work, they created a small gadget that plugs into the HDMI port of a TV or monitor. You then plug another device into the adaptor and, using an app or remote, adjust the colour settings on whatever you are watching. It works with any HD-ready screen, such as a TV or a computer monitor. It charges using a USB cable, which can be plugged into a spare USB port or into a plug. And the goal is to enable people of all sight levels to enjoy shows. At the moment, more than 90 per cent of forms of colour blindness are supported. Around four per cent of the world's population suffers from colour blindness. Their viewing experience is particularly affected when watching particular content types. For example, it can be difficult to tell sports teams apart, particularly if one is playing in red and the other in green, while programmes about wildlife, cookery and art are severely impacted. 'A 2014 Champions League football match between an all red and an all green football team [Liverpool and Ludogrets] was unwatchable for colour blind fans,' explained Christopher Cytera, Managing Director of Spectral Edge, the spin-off company of the university developing the product. But with Eye2TV, the same match could have been watched by people who were colour blind and not alike. The team also says nature shows are difficult to watch, as they often mix colours that are indistinguishable to people who are colour blind. A Champions League football match between Liverpool and Ludogrets on 16 September 2014 (pictured) was criticised because the teams played in red and green, making it difficult from people who suffered from colour blindness to watch the match . With Eye2TV, the same match could have been watched by people who were colour blind and not alike. On the left is the regular version, while on the right is the subtle changes made by the Eyeteq algorithm . Another example is shown here, with the regular spider on the left and an enhanced version right . Playing video games which feature predominantly red or green characters and those with subtle colour differences between good guys and monsters is also difficult. 'The inability to enjoy watching TV or to play video games alongside friends and family is a major frustration to those suffering from colour blindness, significantly impacting their quality of life,' added Mr Cytera. 'Our image enhancement technology is proven to solve this major accessibility issue, and the Eye2TV adapter is poised to transform how colour blind people, and their families, watch TV and video content. 'By launching the project on Kickstarter we can accelerate bringing our technology to the consumer electronics market, giving those with colour blindness the chance to become early adopters and improve their viewing experience.' The company also has an app that is available, enabling people to view content on their smartphone or tablet that they would otherwise not be able to see.", "reference": "Norwich scientists have developed a \u00a350 adaptor for colour blindness .\nIt can be plugged into any HDMI port on a TV or a computer monitor .\nA remote control or app then adjusts the colour adjustment .\nIt allows colour blind people to watch shows they otherwise couldn't .", "pred_summary": "New adaptor allows colour blind people to enjoy TV without a loss of detail.\nIt adjusts colours in the image so that shows look 'normal'\nFour per cent of the world's population suffers from colour blindness."}
{"article": "He was the goalkeeper who only won his place in the side on the back of a teammate shipping an embarrassing eight, so when Costel Pantilimon conceded four goals inside 45 minutes he feared the worst \u2013 for himself and the club\u2019s top-flight status. That was four weeks ago when Aston Villa ran riot at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland were booed from the field at half-time before thousands of fans streamed for the exits.\u00a0Within 48 hours Gus Poyet had been sacked and Dick Advocaat was being installed. The Dutch boss celebrated his first home match with a 1-0 victory over Newcastle last weekend, a result which moved the Black Cats three points clear of the relegation zone ahead of this afternoon\u2019s visit of Crystal Palace. Sunderland Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon celebrates Jermain Defoe's goal against Newcastle United . Pantilimon kept his place despite pressure from Vito Mannone - the man who was dropped in the wake of October\u2019s 8-0 defeat at Southampton \u2013 and the Romanian stopper admits there has been a definite mood change under Advocaat. \u2018Before the new manager came, our confidence was not in a good way,\u2019 said the 28-year-old, who was a Premier League winner with Manchester City in 2012 and again last season. \u2018We were playing very badly, but now we have a new motivation. He\u2019s brought the enjoyment back. \u2018I never expected to play in a game like the 4-0 loss at home to Aston Villa. I was upset. You start to think about what you did wrong. The former Manchester City goalkeeper celebrates with teammate Santiago Vergini at the Stadium of Light . \u2018We had to change something. It wasn\u2019t easy. I thought about relegation after the Villa game. \u2018I was asking myself, \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d. We couldn\u2019t win games at home. Away from home we were taking points, but in front of our fans we were failing. 'It was strange and very frustrating. I didn\u2019t know what we could do to be better.\u2019\u00a0The answer, it appears, was Advocaat. \u2018He has tried to bring us together as a group,\u2019 explained Pantilimon, who has so far avoided one of Advocaat\u2019s infamous fines for a lack of punctuality. \u2018We all eat lunch together as a team. That should be normal. It\u2019s a good idea, it creates a stronger group. It means we get to know each other better and other people\u2019s situations. Pantilimon rolls the ball out to a defender as Sunderland beat Newcastle at the Stadium of Light . \u2018On the pitch, he wants us to be aggressive all the time, but also keep the ball a lot more. \u2018Before the derby he reminded us that not many people have the opportunity to play in a game like this. I think these words said everything, the motivation was at 100 per cent. \u2018The atmosphere last week reminded me a lot of how it was after City won the league (in 2012). \u2018It was incredible. My wife and my parents were there and they loved the game.\u2019 Both of Pantilimon\u2019s parents are deaf and the keeper uses sign language to communicate. Indeed, it was some advice from his father which set him on his way to a career between the posts. The Romanian shot-stopper celebrates a Sunderland win with his team-mates against Newcastle . \u2018I was a striker when I started playing as a child because I liked scoring goals,\u2019 said 6ft 8ins Pantilimon, who was raised in Bacau at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. \u2018My father told me it was better to go in goal. He said I had the physical attributes to play there. \u2018But I was not always so tall. I had a period between 14 and 16 when I grew so fast. \u2018Thankfully, I didn\u2019t like basketball so much. When I was about 15 I realised I could be a professional goalkeeper. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat enjoyed his first victory as manager in the derby game with Newcastle . \u2018I was only 16 when I made my debut for a professional club. It was a third division club, but it was young to make my debut at that level. \u2018I was always confident I could be a goalkeeper. I thought I could get right to the top, I\u2019ve worked hard to be here and I don\u2019t want to stop, I want to get better and better.\u2019 Under Advocaat, things are certainly looking up, for Pantilimon and Sunderland.", "reference": "Costel Pantilimon believes the good times have returned to the club .\nHe believes manager Dick Advocaat has helped improve atmosphere .\nSunderland have been buoyed by their win over neighbours Newcastle .\nDefoe's winner secured Advocaat his first victory as Black Cats boss .", "pred_summary": "Costel Pantilimon says new manager Dick Advocaat has brought a new motivation to Sunderland.\nThe 28-year-old kept his place after a teammate shipping eight goals against Aston Villa.\nBlack Cats are three points clear of the relegation zone ahead of this afternoon's clash with Crystal Palace."}
{"article": "A Florida community has voiced objection to plans of a forensic research 'body farm' in which human bodies will be left in Florida elements for extended periods of time. The body farm, which would be located in Lithia, is a joint project between the University of South Florida Institute of Anthropology and the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. It has the potential to offer forensic scientists and law-enforcement investigators a chance to see what happens to the bodies when they are left in Florida elements. Five to ten bodies from USF's After Life Body Donation Program would be buried or placed on two acres of the Walter C. Heinrich Practical Training Center in Lithia, which is a 230-acre plot of land bordered by a landfill and county property. Scroll down for video . University of South Florida, in a joint project with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, have proposed building a 'body farm' in Lithia for research into how Florida elements affect cadavers . If the research is approved by the Hillsborough County Commission, the information gathered at the site could help investigators solve crimes and cold cases. Hillsborough County Commissioner Stacy White has taken a stand against the facility, while state Attorney General Pam Bondi and Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee have supported the project. 'Just the reputation alone of having a quote 'body farm' in your community could have a drastic impact,' White told WFTS. 'Our perception has always been in East Hillsborough County that we get, for lack of a better term, the junk that no one else wants.' Other areas in the training center are used to teach deputies how to safely drive during chases, shoot a gun and subdue airplane hostage takers, according to the Tampa Bay Tribune. Erin Kimmerle, associate professor of anthropology at USF, said that this research could potentially help solve the more than 500 cold cases in\u00a0Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties . Hillsborough County Commissioner Stacy White has taken a stand against the facility, fearing strong odors and the reputation it could bring to his community . The nearest houses are about half a mile away from the site, and officials from the sheriff's office said the bodies would be surrounded by a seven-foot fence, so no decomposing bodies would be visible to passersby or from houses. A deputy who lives at the site would provide 24-hour security for the bodies. But residents of Lithia are still reluctant to support the project. Some fear that unwanted animals might happen upon the site, including coyotes, panthers and other\u00a0predators. Resident William Rayburn, whose five acres of land border the training facility, fears the bodies might bring with them an unpleasant smell. 'You say you can contain the smell, but what's it going to do when the heat gets up and the wind starts blowing and we're sitting on our porch swing we've worked hard to have in our retirement and those bodies get rancid?' Rayburn told the Tampa Tribune. 'I can smell the dump 10 miles away.' As of now, there is no timeline for the project, which has been in the works for more than a year, though it was just announced to residents a few weeks ago. Erin Kimmerle, associate professor of anthropology at USF, said that there are more than 500 cold cases in Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties, and the facility could help change that. Kimmerle said that no taxpayer money would be used to fund the project, but rather grants and donations would be used. She added that there would be no odor or affect on the soil and water in the area . 'Improving on our current methods helps solve long-term open cases and that's what this is ultimately about,' Kimmerle told the Tampa Bay Tribune. 'It's a tremendous gift to give these remains back to a family.' She added that the body farm would not draw taxpayer money and wouldn't contaminate soil or water or create an odor. It would operate solely on donations and grant funding. White told the Tampa Bay Times that a dialogue had not been engaged with 'any local officials', though Kimmerle said she's been working with the Sheriff's office since March 2014. 'How in the world would someone think people are going to react when they hear that a 'body farm' might be coming into the community? This is an ivory tower academia mind-set at its finest,' White said.", "reference": "The body farm would be located in Lithia in Hillsborough County .\nIt is a joint project between the University of South Florida Institute of Anthropology and the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office .\nResidents fear it will bring unwanted predators and a strong odor to area .\nUSF associate professor\u00a0Erin Kimmerle said the project could help investigators solve cold cases and other crimes .\nThere are more than 500 cold cases in Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties - areas close to the research facility .", "pred_summary": "University of South Florida and Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office want to research what happens to bodies when left in Florida elements.\nProject could help solve more than 500 cold cases in Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties.\nCounty commissioner fears strong odors and reputation it could bring to his community."}
{"article": "Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows. Decades of cheap package holidays mean that thousands of retired people every year are paying with their health for sunburn they experienced in their youth. According to Cancer Research UK, men aged 65 and over are around ten times more likely to be diagnosed with malignant melanoma than those of their parents\u2019 generation. Scroll down for video . Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows . And older women are about five times more likely to develop this disease than someone of the same age were in the mid-1970s. Around 5,700 pensioners are now diagnosed with melanoma each year in the UK compared with just 600 a year four decades ago. Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn when they were young, experts said last night. Although age is a major risk factor for melanoma, the huge increase is blamed on the cheap package holiday boom dating from the 1960s. Overall, 55.2 of every 100,000 people aged over 65 are diagnosed with skin cancer every year. In 1975 just 7.9 per 100,000 were diagnosed - a seven-fold increase. The figures are part of a worrying increase in incidents that affects all age groups. The continuing obsession with sporting a tan means the toll is likely to keep rising. Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person\u2019s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest . Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person\u2019s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest. Around 13,300 people across a wide range of ages are diagnosed with malignant melanoma in the UK each year making it the country\u2019s fifth most common cancer overall and the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15 to 34. And with sunbeds still very popular, the number of diagnoses is expected to rise to 20,000 a year by 2027. In 1975 the figure was just 1,800. Professor Richard Marais, Cancer Research UK\u2019s skin cancer expert: \u2018It\u2019s worrying to see melanoma rates increasing at such a fast pace, and across all age groups. \u2018It\u2019s very important for people to take care of their skin in the sun. \u2018It\u2019s also important for them to keep an eye on their skin and seek medical opinion if they see any changes to their moles, or even to normal areas of skin. \u2018Melanoma is often detected on men\u2019s backs and women\u2019s legs but can appear on any part of the body.\u2019 Each year, 2,100 Britons die from the disease. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK\u2019s head of health information, said: \u2018Many cases of malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, are preventable by taking precautions in the sun and making sure you don\u2019t burn. \u2018Sun damage accumulates over time so avoiding sunburn - and sunbeds - is key, as well as getting to know your skin type so you don\u2019t overdo it on the beach or even in the garden. \u2018You can burn at home just as easily as you can on holiday, so remember to spend time in the shade, wear a T shirt and a hat to protect your skin and regularly apply sunscreen that is at least Factor 15 and has four stars. \u2018Swapping bad sun habits for good ones could save your life.\u2019 Sue Deans, a 69-year-old retired teacher and mother-of-three from Croydon, south London, who was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2000 after having a mole removed, said: \u2018I was part of the generation where package holidays became affordable and you could go abroad nearly every year. \u2018I don\u2019t think there was much understanding at the time about the impact that too much sun can have on your risk of getting skin cancer. \u2018And I loved the sun but suffered quite a bit of sunburn over the years. \u2018I\u2019ve always been quite body aware so my cancer was spotted early. \u2018I had successful surgery and have been healthy since, but I\u2019m always vigilant in keeping an eye out for anything unusual or persistent that might need to be checked. \u2018Now I make sure my grandson knows the dangers of getting caught out in the sun.\u2019", "reference": "Decades of cheap holidays means retirees are paying for sunburn in youth .\nMen over 65 ten times more likely to have disease than parents' generation .\nAround 5,700 pensioners now diagnosed with melanoma each year in UK .", "pred_summary": "Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago.\n huge increase blamed on cheap package holiday boom in the 1960s."}
{"article": "Homicide conviction: Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, arrives for verdicts at Gwangju High Court in Gwangju, South Korea . The South Korean ferry captain responsible for a sinking that killed more than 300 people has had his sentence increased to life in prison. Lee Joon-seok had been ordered to serve 36 years in prison for negligence and abandoning passengers aboard the Sewol, by a district court following last year's disaster. But this was increased to life in prison today by an appellate court that convicted him of homicide by account of his 'willful negligence'. The 6,825-tonne passenger ship sank off the southwest coast on April 16 last year, killing 304 people. Most of the victims were teenagers who were en route to a southern island for a school trip. Victims' relatives criticised the original verdict which had acquitted him of homicide, saying it was too lenient. But his sentence was increased because the Gwangju High Court additionally convicted him on the homicide charges while upholding most of other charges that led to his November conviction, according to a court statement. The appellate court sentenced 14 other navigation crew members to 18 months to 12 years in prison, the statement said. In November they had received sentences of five to 30 years in prison. The court said it decided on Lee's homicide conviction because he fled the ship without making any evacuation order though he, as a captain, is required by law to take some measures to rescue his passengers. Lee's behavior was 'homicide by willful negligence,' the court judged. 'For whatever excuses, it's difficult to forgive Lee Joon-seok's action that caused a big tragedy,' the court statement cited the verdict as saying. Lee and the 14 crew members have been the subject of fierce public anger because they were among the first people rescued from the ship when it began badly listing on the day of the sinking in April last year.

Lee has said he issued an evacuation order, but the court statement said two of the 14 crew members acknowledged that there was no evacuation order. Many student survivors have said they were repeatedly ordered over a loudspeaker to stay on the sinking ship and that they didn't remember there any evacuation orders made by crew members before they helped each other to flee the ship. Judges sit to preside over verdicts for the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol's crew members who are charged with negligence and abandonment of passengers in the disaster at Gwangju High Court in Gwangju . Court spokesman Jeon Ilho said both prosecutors and the crew members have one week to appeal the verdicts. Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, was sentenced to life in prison . A year after sinking, 295 bodies have been retrieved but nine others are missing. There is still lingering public criticism against the government over its handling of the sinking, the country's deadliest maritime disaster in decades. Violence occurred during a Seoul rally led by relatives and their supporters earlier this month, leaving dozens of people injured. Last week, South Korea formally announced it would salvage the ship from the ocean floor off the country's southwest coast. Relatives of the victims hope that might locate the missing, including four students, and help reveal more details about the sinking. Some experts are skeptical about those wishes and remain opposed to spending taxpayer's money to lift the civilian vessel. Officials say the salvage job is estimated to cost \u00a368 million and take 12 to 18 months. Authorities blame excessive cargo, improper storage, botched negligence and other negligence for the sinking, and have arrested about 140 people.

{"article": "Andy Flower, England team director who guided sides to three Ashes triumphs and the world No 1 spot, will not be interfering in any way with the work of the next director of England cricket. The England Cricket Board gave Flower the confusing title of technical director of elite coaching after he renegotiated a new role at significantly lower pay after resigning as team boss following the last Ashes whitewash. This has led to speculation that Flower\u2019s continuing role on the ECB staff would conflict with the job description of the new appointment. Former England\u00a0team director Andy Flower is now\u00a0technical director of elite coaching at the ECB . But effectively Flower is now running the England cricket academy at Loughborough and working with young players in a coaching role, and liaising with counties. And it\u2019s understood he has no wish to get involved at England senior level again or become entangled in the politics. Those politics have Kevin Pietersen at centre stage as ever. But Flower, having closed one chapter in his life and fully moved on to his behind-the-scenes Loughborough role, is highly unlikely to speak out about KP now. Meanwhile, Pietersen, who is using social media app Periscope to film himself getting a sun tan or whistling, continues to dominate the PR battle against the ECB, who botched his axing and have totally mismanaged the fall-out since. Kevin Pietersen is back playing cricket for Surrey in the hope of winning back a Test spot in the England side . It looks only a matter of time before Manuel Pellegrini is sacked as Manchester City manager. And his son Juan, who is living in England, isn\u2019t waiting for the axe to fall on his father, having already made plans to take his wife and four children back to Chile. However, Juan\u2019s return is purely for family reasons with his wife, who has just had twins, wanting family support to look after four kids who are under the age of five. Only the ECB\u2019s hopeless media team could launch the domestic NatWest T20 Blast, which needs all the promotional hype it can muster to compete with the IPL and Big Bash, on the same day as an England Test match. And only the ECB, having brought in former Ashes hero Freddie Flintoff to drum up publicity for the launch, could then decide he shouldn\u2019t speak to national newspapers. An ECB spokesman said the date wasn\u2019t ideal but they were constrained by the domestic and international schedule. And the print media snub was due to the ECB having limited time with Flintoff. Andrew Flintoff (left) shares a joke with Warwickshire and England's Chris Woakes at the T20 Blast launch . There was a player for all 18 counties present at the T20 Blast launch on Thursday . It can cause problems in football when agents represent players and managers. But the ECB have no concerns that former county cricketer Luke Sutton represents both Jimmy Anderson and England head coach Peter Moores. Likewise, the FA say they have no problems with England manager Roy Hodgson\u2019s agent being Leon Angel who also looks after emerging international Danny Rose. Coincidentally, West Indies coach Phil Simmons is paid well enough to need the advice of David Manasseh, whose Stellar agency clients include the world\u2019s most expensive footballer Gareth Bale. Sepp\u2019s no messiah . Sepp Blatter\u2019s smooth procession to a ridiculous fifth term as FIFA president continued at the Central American CONCACAF Congress in the Bahamas. Such was the lack of democracy Blatter\u2019s three rivals weren\u2019t even given the opportunity to address delegates.

{"article": "In an unprecedented move, Russia has cancelled the release of a Hollywood thriller set in the Stalin era - claiming it distorts history and would air as the country celebrates its victory over Nazi Germany. The film, 'Child 44', starring Tom Hardy, Vincent Cassel and Gary Oldman, tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the Stalin era. It is based on a novel by British writer Tom Rob Smith and was due to premiere in Russia today. Scroll down for video . Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Child 44, starring Gary Oldman (left) and Tom Hardy . The Hollywood blockbuster tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in Stalin era Russia . Russia's culture ministry said the film distorted history as it celebrated its victory over Nazi Germany . Russia's culture ministry said the film's distributors in Russia, Central Partnership, had agreed to withdraw a request for a distribution licence after ministry officials viewed the film. 'Films such as 'Child 44' should not go out in our country on mass release, earning money from our cinema audiences, not in the year of the 70th anniversary of victory, not ever,' Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky wrote on the ministry's website. The move to effectively ban a major mainstream Hollywood film just a day before it was due to premiere is unprecedented. In recent years, Russia has cracked down harshly on negative depictions of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, while criticism of those who fought in the Second World War is taboo. The culture ministry accused the film of 'distortion of historical facts and the idiosyncratic treatment of events before, during and after' the war. The film is set in 1952, a year before Stalin's death, and features a maverick investigator seeking a serial killer, while hindered by official attitudes that such murders are not possible in the Soviet Union. Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky (pictured) condemned the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime . 'You realise murder is strictly a capitalist disease,' French star Cassel hisses in a thick Russian accent in the film's English-language trailer. Culture minister Medinsky slammed the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime and said it misrepresented a country that was 'one of the world leaders'. The film shows Soviet Army officers as 'blood-thirsty ghouls' randomly shooting people, 'especially gays,' Medinsky complained. Soviet women have to offer them sexual favours or 'be sent, as is customary, to the Gulag,' he added with heavy irony. The decision to pull the film came after the culture ministry on Tuesday gave it a distribution licence with an 18+ certificate. The head of Central Partnership, Pavel Stepanov, issued a statement saying he was 'satisfied' with the film's ban. 'We consider it's important in the future to increase state control over distribution of films that have a socially significant context,' he said. On Tuesday, Kultura state-funded arts newspaper, whose editor is a member of President Vladimir Putin's arts council, published a review of the film titled '44 shades of vileness.' 'Daniel Espinosa's film is made up of lies and spitting at Russia and Russians,' it wrote. Earlier this year the outspoken culture minister voiced his dislike of Russian art-house film 'Leviathan,' despite its landmark victory at the Golden Globes and Oscar nomination, complaining it was full of 'existentialist hopelessness.' Last month he sacked the head of a theatre in Siberia after its radical staging of a Wagner opera including images of Jesus Christ angered some Orthodox believers.", "reference": "Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Hollywood's Child 44 .\nThe blockbuster film stars Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman and Vincent Cassel .\nIt depicts a private investigator attempting to hunt down a serial child killer .\nRussia's culture minister accused the film of 'distortion of historical facts'", "pred_summary": "The film, starring Tom Hardy, Vincent Cassel and Gary Oldman, tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the Stalin era.\nIt is based on a novel by British writer Tom Rob Smith and was due to premiere in Russia today.\nRussia's culture ministry accused the film of 'distortion of historical facts'"}

{"article": "Seven female students, some of whom attend Brigham Young University in Utah, were catfished by the same 24-year-old woman who was pretending to be a man. The victims all believed they were involved in a relationship with a Mormon man living in the same state - only to find out they were being duped by a woman named Kayla in Texas. And the women had a chance to confront the woman, named Kayla, on an episode of Dr Phil\u00a0that aired on Friday. Scroll down for videos . Seven women who were all believed to be in an online relationship with the same man found out that they had been catfished by a 24-year-old woman in Texas named Kayla . Kayla apologized to the women, saying she was trying to figure out who she was because it's 'difficult' to be both gay and Mormon . 'Can I ask what triggered this in the first place and why you've done it for so long?' one of the women asked. Kayla responded by saying she tried to figure out her life in the 'wrong way'. 'It's for the simple fact that being gay and being Mormon is hard,' Kayla said. 'Your church tells you, \"We love you, but we don't love who you are\".' In the episode she apologizes to the women, most of whom forgive her and say they would have been her friend in other circumstances. 'I'm sorry that I dragged you guys into my mess. Whether you believe me or not, that's up to you,' she said to the women. The women has spoken to the women for various amounts of time, ranging from a month to more than a year. Kayla had taken the identity of a man named Keagan, who goes to school in Montana. He apologized to the women who all had been talking to a Kayla, who used Keagan's pictures online . The women's faces all looked disappointed and shocked when Kayla first walked through the door, revealing herself as the person they had all been talking to . The women mostly wanted to know why Kayla decided to pretend to be a man and why she had spoken to some of the women for longer than others . Kayla had stolen the identity of a Montana student named Keagan, who the women had a chance to meet on the Dr Phil segment. He had no idea his identity had been stolen and apologized to the women for what had happened to them. One victim said that the man she thought she was talking to told her he loved her, while another said he became 'her perfect guy' and that it 'almost seemed too good to be true'. It emerged that Kayla was a catfish - someone who tricks others online by setting up fake profiles with fake pictures and names- after one of the women became suspicious and looked into the man she had been talking to. Kayla told Dr Phil that she 'didn't have any evil intentions' and that she was just trying to figure herself out. 'I created an online persona so I could figure out who I was, and figure out if I was gay or not and figure out if I wanted to be part of the religion or not.' Kayla, who now says she is gay, said. She added: 'Do I want to be part of the church, or do I want to be gay? And unfortunately, I saw myself in a position where I couldn't have both... You don't understand how difficult that is.' Victim Hilary Hayes said she had been texted out of the blue by someone calling himself 'Hunter Anderson' who claimed to have seen her at a party and that he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The women appeared uncomfortable at times during the interview and some even rolled their eyes at what Kayla was saying. Most of the women, however, agreed to forgive Kayla for what she did . She told Fox13 that they would regularly text and talk and he even sent her flowers on Valentine's Day - but that Anderson would never agree to meet up. At the same time, another victim, Sara Vanwagenen, believed she was in a relationship with a man called 'Hyrum Young'. She too reported that the person they were in contact with would never agree to meet up. The pair eventually realised the texts they were receiving were from the same number and it turned out they had both been duped by a woman called Kayla, from Texas. Vanwagenen is reported as saying: 'I let this person into my life in a really big way. I was really angry and really hurt.' Hayes added: 'She just knew everything about me it was just really hurtful to find out that you literally didn't know anything about this person, not even something so foundational as their name.'

{"article": "A pre-med student in New York City is taking microscopic images of diseases and other biological structures and turning them into prints for her innovative new\u00a0athletic apparel and accessories line. Lizzie Cochran, a student at Columbia University, has launched a\u00a0KickStarter campaign to fund her upcoming fashion line\u00a0Epidemia Designs, which she came up with after spending days upon days staring at cells through microscopes in her biology classes, and then spotting an article on epidemics that displayed images of deadly diseases from recent history. 'The one that jumped out at me was the flu of 1918 virus,' Lizzie told Today. 'It was one of the most devastating epidemics in the history of the world, but there on the page, colored with dyes, it just looked incredible, interesting and vibrant.' Scroll down for video . From the microscope to the mat: Proposed clothing line Epidemia will take images from biology and print them on eye-catching active apparel . Picture of health: Among the designs is a sports bra showing images from a healthy mammogram . Lizzie, who will be returning to her native Texas for medical school in the fall at University of Texas San Antonio, was soon mocking up ideas for clothing incorporating the beautiful and unique imagery she'd seen on slides during her classes. Using mirroring, Photoshop and kaleidoscope effects, each biological subject was turned into an eye-catching pattern that could be printed on fabric. The designs in the line include scarves printed with rabies and chicken pox patterns, a flu of 1918 tote bag and yoga pants depicting polio, muscle cells and rabies. The patterns will also be available for printing on iPhone cases after the company, which has already raised $13,798, reaches its $15,000 crowdfunding goal. In her design work, Lizzie also began to see the potential for changing perceptions of infectious diseases, as well as the relatively apathy towards them that results in the preventable deaths of 1.5 million children per year simply because they haven't been vaccinated. The brains of the outfit: Pre-med student Lizzie\u00a0Cochran came up with the idea for the fashion line after studying biology under a microscope . Giving 'cell phone' a whole new meaning: Epidemia will offer phone cases with eye catching patterns from microscopic images including that of heart tissue, chicken pox and polio . From the Petri dish to the yoga pant: Epidemia legging,s like the pair featuring a lung x-ray design pictured, will initially be priced at around $75 . 'Frankly, it's unacceptable,' Lizzie told Today. 'It's not like we're trying to solve an unsolvable problem. We really have the power to lead the way toward a healthier future. We already have the tools.' With this idea in mind, Lizzie is promising to send 15 per cent of the profits to funding projects aimed at limiting the impact of preventable diseases such as polio, rubella and hepatitis, as well as expanding medical care access around the globe. Now, with an expanding team - and an exploding online following - Epidemia's goal of $15,000 has nearly been reached, meaning the line is just on the cusp of going into production. Team Epidemia: Based on the strength of her idea, Lizzie has enlisted a new VP of retail,\u00a0Taylor Newby (third from right), and several friends as models for the project . Showing off their muscles: The Kickstarter campaign to produce the clothing for the public has nearly reached its goal of $15,000 . The first group of designs lined up will be called 'She's Got It' will have the theme of beauty in a woman's body and will feature images of brain, nerve, heart and epithelial (stomach). Aside from bringing awareness of preventable diseases to the forefront, the 'She's Got It' line has its own unique purpose. 'We hope women will wear these clothes and feel empowered to join the discussions of public health, science and technology that are so vital to our world,' Lizzie explained. 'Our hope is that our stylish, feminine, fun, and most importantly, interesting designs will appeal to girls of all ages - and maybe encourage them to get involved in the scientific community.'", "reference": "Pre-med student Lizzie Cochran has created clothing and accessories influenced by the microscopic structure of anatomy and disease .\nShe has set up a KickStarter campaign to fund her venture, called Epidemia Designs, and has nearly reached her goal of $15,000 .\n15 per cent of profits will go to projects aiming to lower the impact of preventable diseases around the world .", "pred_summary": "Pre-med student Lizzie Cochran has launched Epidemia Designs to fund her new apparel and accessories line.\nPlans include scarves printed with rabies and chicken pox patterns, yoga pants depicting polio and muscle cells.\n patterns will also be available for printing on iPhone cases."}

The nationalists are also on course to wipe out the Liberal Democrats in Scotland, with even Charles Kennedy, their popular former leader, now 15 points behind in his Highlands constituency. The survey of eight constituencies, by Lord Ashcroft, revealed swings to the SNP on a scale which would be unprecedented in modern European politics. The survey suggests Labour could lose all 41 seats it won in 2010. Tactical anti-SNP voting by supporters of other parties could save some. There are 59 seats in Scotland. Mr Murphy is nine points behind in his East Renfrewshire seat with the SNP buoyed by leader Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s strong performance in two TV debates. That means there has been a 26.5 per cent swing away from Labour since 2010. Labour conceded that \u2018no gloss\u2019 could be put on the polls and warned that if the findings become reality then \u2018David Cameron will walk back into Downing Street again\u2019. Conor Pope, of party supporters\u2019 website LabourList, said: \u2018If previous Ashcroft constituency polling in Scotland could be described as an earthquake, the poll the Tory peer had dropped this afternoon will require an entirely different word. A cataclysm perhaps. \u2018If this is an earthquake it\u2019s certainly not the kind that rattles the windows in the middle of the night, it\u2019s the sort that razes whole cities. \u2018If Lord Ashcroft\u2019s polling is correct, there\u2019s a risk that Jim Murphy could lose his seat to the SNP. At the last poll he had a slender one point lead over the SNP, that has now turned in a matter of weeks into a nine-point lead for the SNP. That\u2019s well outside the margin of error. The rampant Scottish National Party, led by Nicola Sturgeon (pictured), has extended its lead over Labour . \u2018What was once a Labour/Tory marginal could well fall to the forces of separatism. Such a result would be a painful \u2013 almost existential \u2013 blow to a Scottish Labour Party that is already battered and bruised.\u2019 Yesterday, Mr Murphy launched a desperate attempt to regain support by abandoning his Blairite views in a bid to win over left-wing voters. Mr Murphy unveiled Labour\u2019s Scottish election manifesto in Glasgow as he declared \u2018the party of John Smith and the party of Donald Dewar is back in business\u2019. Overlooking the Tony Blair \u2018New Labour\u2019 era, during which he served as a minister, he allowed retiring Labour MP David Hamilton to whip the crowd into a frenzy by attacking Margaret Thatcher and laying into the SNP with the battle cry: \u2018They are nationalists, we are socialists.\u2019 Mr Murphy himself vowed to introduce socialist-style \u2018redistributive\u2019 policies, as he accused the SNP of stealing Labour\u2019s clothes.", "reference": "Polling shows Scottish National Party has extended its lead over Labour .\nConstituency surveys suggest Labour party faces unprecedented wipeout .\nJim Murphy, its Scottish leader, among those on course to lose their seats .", "pred_summary": "Poll of eight constituencies reveals 26.5 per cent swing away from Labour since 2010.\nLabour's Scottish leader Jim Murphy and its chief election strategist Douglas Alexander could lose their seats.\nSNP also on course to wipe out the Liberal Democrats."}

The body of murdered teenager Becky Watts had to be identified by her DNA, an inquest into her death has heard. Becky, 16, went missing from her Bristol home in February and her dismembered body parts were found 11 days later. An inquest into her death has been opened and adjourned while criminal proceedings, involving her step-brother, take place. Nathan Matthews, 28, faces a single count of murdering his step-sister, while his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, is accused of perverting the court of justice. Jaydene Parsons, 23, James Ireland, 23, and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, are accused of assisting an offender. Miss Watts was living with her father\u00a0Darren Galsworthy, and her step-mother, Anjie, before she went missing from their home in St George, Bristol, on February 19. Her disappearance sparked a huge search. The teenager's remains were found 11 days later on March 2, at a house in the Barton Hill area of the city three miles away. The inquest at\u00a0Flax Bourton in Somerset did not give a cause of the teenager's death. None of Miss Watts' family were present. Coroner's officer Deborah Neil told the court: 'Her death was confirmed on March 3 by a pathologist. She was identified by DNA. 'The brief circumstances are that Rebecca was reported to the police as a missing person. 'She was found later at an address in the Barton Hill area. She underwent a post-mortem examination at Flax Bourton and people have since been charged in connection with her murder.' Avon Coroner Maria Voisin adjourned the inquest until the outcome of criminal proceedings. She said the case would be reviewed in August. Scroll down for video . A funeral service for the teenager will take place on April 17\u00a0at St Ambrose Church in the Whitehall area of the city. Members of the public have raised almost \u00a35,000 towards the cost of the funeral. A notice published in the Bristol Post said the church was reserved for family and close friends but the service would be relayed to mourners outside. Afterwards there will be a private family burial. Mr Galsworthy and his wife Anjie said in a statement:\u00a0'Becky was approaching the threshold of her adult life; she had so much to look forward to and love to share with all that were close and dear to her. Miss Watts' remains were discovered 11 days after her disappearance at a house in Barton Hill . 'We will miss her so much. 'All of us as a family, including those that knew Becky would like to express our most sincere gratitude to everyone that donated towards this day. 'Becky's death has touched the hearts of so many people; some from as far away as the other side of the world. 'We never expected that response but we are so very grateful for your thoughts, your prayers and your donations. Miss Watts had been living with her father in St George, Bristol, when she went missing . 'It is because of your kind support that we know the day will be a fitting tribute to a much loved daughter, grand-daughter, sister, niece and friend to so many people. 'We ask for your co-operation with regards to Becky's final laying to rest at the cemetery. 'We would like this to be very private and out of the public gaze, allowing us to say our final goodbye as we lay her to rest.' Matthews, of Warmley, South Gloucestershire, appeared at Bristol Crown Court on March 26, along with five others charged in connection with the death. His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police. Jaydene Parsons, 23, James Ireland, and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, are accused of helping dispose of and conceal Becky's body parts.

{"article": "Teller Lake has become a giant fish bowl. The lake in Boulder, Colorado, has been invaded by thousands of gold fish, which wildlife officials say started as someone dumping 'four or five' of their pets in the water two or three years ago. The animals have now multiplied to over 3,000 or 4,000, it's believed, and are threatening to over-run the natural species in the lake, by eating up all their resources and spreading unnatural diseases. 'Dumping your pets into a lake could bring diseases to native animals and plants as well as out-compete them for resources,'Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Invasion:\u00a0Lake Teller in Boulder has been invaded by 3,000 to 4,000 goldfish, which wildlife officials say started as someone dumping 'four or five' of their pets in the water two or three years ago . Overrun: Goldfish are not a native species in Colorado and are very harmful to the local aquatic ecosystem . Threat:\u00a0Fish that are native to the lake that are now being threatened by the invasive goldfish include channel catfish, blue gill fish and sun fish . In danger: Local officials are now considering two options - electroshocking the fish or draining the lake . Worried:\u00a0Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill has warned people against dumping their pets into local environments, saying it can be incredibly dangerous . 'Everything can be affected. Non-native species can potentially wipe out the fishery as we've put it together.' Crews now face the arduous tasking of attempting to get rid of all the gold fish, but there are only two options. One is to drain the 12-acre lake completely, or use electrofishing, where the fish are stunned by an electrical current and removed while they are paralyzed. The latter is the most likely option. Problem: The consequences of introducing a foreign species is far-reaching, officials say . Scene: Teller Lake stretches about 12 acres in Boulder, Colorado . An electrical current is put in the water in sections and the stunning brings the fish to the surface. It was a successful method used in November 2012 at Thunderbird Lake, also in Boulder, to remove koi goldfish from the water that had been improperly introduced. Some 2,275 fish were removed in the process. 'Most people don't realize the far-reaching effects of introducing exotic species to the environment,' Ken Kehmeier, senior aquatic biologist for CPW, told The Denver Chanel. 'Nonnative species can be devastating to native populations by causing disease outbreaks and creating competition unbalance. Removal: In November 2012, over 2,000 koi goldfish were removed from the nearby\u00a0Thunderbird Lake by 'electrofishing', where the fish are shocked with an electric current and paralyzed, causing them to float . Effective: With electroshocking, crews go out in a boat and stun the fish to paralyze and then collect them . 'It's an issue that anyone concerned with our environment should know about.' Despite the amount of fish in the lake, officials have warned locals against retrieving some of the fish and taking them home as pets. The gold fish will likely end up at a local raptor rehabilitation program as food. 'We don't have a timeline yet for when we're going to do that,' Churchill said.", "reference": "Teller Lake in Boulder, Colorado, is overrun with 3,000-4,000 goldfish .\nOfficials believe four or five fish were dumped two or three years ago .\nWill potentially destroy the natural ecosystem by eating resources and introducing foreign diseases .\nThe lake will either be drained or the fish removed using electroshocking, where an electrical current is put in the water, paralyzing the fish .", "pred_summary": "Teller Lake in Boulder, Colorado, has been invaded by 3,000 to 4,000 goldfish.\nWildlife officials warn people against dumping pets into local environments.\nGoldfish are not a native species in Colorado and are very harmful to the local aquatic ecosystem."}

{"article": "A teenager who fell ill with flu four months ago is unable to move her arms and legs and can barely eat or talk. Doctors are still trying to find out what the future holds for 17-year-old Natasha Willard after she was diagnosed with inflammation of the brain when she fell ill while studying for her A-levels in Cwmbran in Wales. Miss Willard's family are unsure how the teenager became ill so suddenly, just four days after she returned her feeling unwell. They are now trying to teach her to walk and talk again. Natasha Willard was studying for her A levels at college when she appeared to get the flu just before Christmas and her condition has worsened, leaving her unable to move her limbs and barely able to speak . Her stepmother Kirsty Willard said:\u00a0'The doctors are baffled, they do not know what happened. 'They have given her antibiotics and she is on steroids too. 'We are just left in limbo. The doctors have not said what the future holds; they cannot give us that information.' Natasha has been diagnosed with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. Natasha appeared fit and well days before she came home ill, and appeared to quickly go down hill . Mrs Willard said doctors have told them they are unsure whether she will make progress, but have warned the family she is unlikely to fully return to herself. Natasha, from Cwmbran, was studying art and Welsh in the sixth form at Torfaen's Llantarnam School when she fell ill. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Symptoms include seizures, convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, haemorrhaging, and memory loss. Encephalitis develops in reaction to a viral infection or when the body's own immune system attacks brain tissue. The condition can also be caused by the immune system reacting to a tumour. Around 4,000 people are diagnosed with encephalitis every year. Some people make a full recovery from the condition but others can be left with permanent damage to the brain and complications including memory loss and epilepsy. She came home on December 5 after a night out with friends and went straight to bed. Over the next few days Miss Willard started vomiting and had aches and pains, and her family presumed she had the flu. But on December 9 she collapsed and was mumbling and had to be taken to hospital. The teenager cannot remember the first four weeks of her illness and\u00a0 was unresponsive for the first three. She was then transferred from University of Wales Hospital, Cardiff, to Rookwood Hospital, also in Cardiff, for intensive physiotherapy and speech therapy. 'She can say a few words,' said Mrs Willard. 'She can say \"Hi dad\" and \"Hi Kirsty.\" She can say her own name, and her brothers' names, her sister's name and she can say \"yeah.\"' Mrs Willard said they are having to teach the 17-year-old everything from scratch, as if she is a child again. But, she adds that she has not complained about her condition. Mrs Willard, who works in a bar, said they are worried about the reaction of people when the teenager is discharged from hospital. 'I would hate to think her friends would see her in a wheelchair and abandon her,' she said . Miss Willard (left) is pictured before her prom in 2014 and with her father Robert (right) before she became ill . Miss Willard's family have been told by doctors that they do not know if she will make a full recovery . November will be the teenager's 18th birthday and her family are hoping she will be able to come home. The family have been raising funds to pay for their hospital visits and have collected \u00a3700 packing bags in Cwmbran's Asda. 'We rely on lifts and buses,' Kirsty said.

{"article": "Frankie Dettori will be left to focus on the British Flat season this summer after boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani signed up Gregory Benoist to ride the horses which race under his Al Shaqab banner in France. The only exception will be Sheik Joaan\u2019s dual Arc winner Treve, who will continue to be partnered by veteran Thierry Jarnet. Benoist is the only jockey to have ridden Elie Lellouche-trained Ectot, who was unplaced for Al Shaqab in last year\u2019s Arc having gone into the race one of the leading fancies having won the Prix Niel. Frankie Dettori is to concentrate on the British flat season and not being picked to ride in France . The recruitment of Benoist could be seen as a snub for Dettori, who was replaced by Jarnet on Treve in the build-up to her Arc success. But Herbert insisted it was no longer logistically feasible to have one jockey covering both countries because Sheik Joaan\u2019s operation has expanded so much. Herbert said: \u2018Last season it was feasible to keep travelling back and forth across the Channel but we have more horses this year \u2013 80 in France and almost 100 in Britain. \u2018It makes more sense to have a jockey based over there. Gregory Benoist is the rider signed up to race the\u00a0Al Shaqab banner in France this summer . \u2018Frankie is happy with it and he will still ride British horses which we send to run in France. \u2018The contract has literally been signed today. We have a very good relationship with Gregory. Thierry Jarnet will still ride Treve- there is no point breaking up a partnership that works.\u2019 Dettori finished third on Al Shaqab\u2019s Moheet in yesterday\u2019s Novae Bloodstock Craven Stakes at Newmarket. The Richard Hannon-trained colt, which had won its only previous race at Salisbury last year, showed signs of inexperience in a tactical affair won by his Richard Hughes-ridden, front-running stablemate Kool Kompany. Hannon, who runs both Ivawood and Estidhkaar in tomorrow\u2019s Greenham Stakes at Newbury, said both his Craven colts could run in the Guineas but, interestingly, Hughes hinted that either the German or French versions, both run around a bend as opposed to a straight course, might suit length and a quarter winner Kool Kompany best. Sheikh Joaan Al Thani (centre) chose not to go with Dettori and insists that he's happy with his choice . Most significant Guineas action possibly took place before racing started on the Rowley Mile when Charlie Hills-trained Acomb Stakes winner Connection put in a decent gallop under William Buick, who Hills hopes will ride his colt in the Classic back here on May 2. Retiring champion jump jockey AP McCoy was unplaced on his final ride at Cheltenham when Milan Bound finished seventh in the handicap hurdle won by Aqalim. McCoy rides at Ayr for the next two days, including the mount on Paul Nicholls-trained Benvolio in Friday's Scottish National.

Grieving Nikki Thomas, from South Wales, says she wants to turn back the clock and tell Jenna that she didn't have to 'put up' with her former partner's obsessive behaviour, including bombarding her with hundreds of calls and texts a day. But Jenna, who was strangled to death by Philip Packer\u00a0in a jealous rage in 2008, never reported his behaviour to police - and paid the ultimate price. Scroll down for video . Nikki Thomas appeared on This Morning to tell how her sister was murdered by her obsessive ex . Now Nikki, 27, is warning others to learn from her sister's tragic story and not tolerate stalking behaviour. As part of Stalking Awareness Week, Nikki, from North Cornelly, \u00adappeared on today's This Morning in honour of her sister. She told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden how Jenna had started a relationship with Packer, who was 28 years older than she was, when she was a teenager. But shop worker Jenna found Parker, a nightclub doorman, could be obsessive and controlling so she eventually ended their relationship. However, Nikki said he then wouldn't leave her sister - then aged 21 - alone. She recalled: 'In 2009 she left him saying she wasn't happy. He was very controlling, obsessive and jealous. 'He wouldn't stop contacting her. He would ring 300-400 times a day and that was just phone calls. There were also texts and visits.' Jenna was strangled to death by\u00a0Philip Packer, pictured, who used to hound her with calls and messages . Nikki said neither she or Jenna realised how far Packer would go and 'kind' Jenna didn't consider reporting him to the police. Nikki said: 'My family and I were worried but she thought she had a handle on it. She never said she was frightened for her safety. 'She wasn't scared of him but it was unwanted attention - she made that clear to him but he persisted. She didn't go to police as she thought she could deal with it.' Nikki said Packer would often turn up unannounced at Jenna's house to drive her to work, or if she was waiting at the bus stop, he could pull over and offer her a lift. This is what happened on June 24, 2009, but Jenna never made it to her work place. After offering her a lift, Packer, then aged 49, took her to a layby and strangled her to death. He then drove to a police station and told them he had a dead body in his car. Six months later he appeared at\u00a0Cardiff Crown Court where a jury found him guilty of murder. Nikki and TV presenter Rav Wilding, left, appeared on This Morning to promote Stalking Awareness Week . He was jailed for a minimum of 18 years (later reduced to 16 years). Nikki now wishes she had urged her sister to put a stop to Packer's stalking behaviour. She could have sought a restraining order preventing him from contacting or going near her. Nikki said: 'If we could turn back the clock I'd tell her you don't have to put up with this.' She is hoping others will heed her warning as figures from the National Stalking Advocacy reveal that one in six women and one in 12 men are stalked at some point in their lives. TV presenter Rav Wilding is also supporting the campaign after being the victim of a stalker himself. He revealed on This Morning how a woman used to bombard him with hundreds of 'vile and grotesque' messages. Rav had to take out a restraining order on a woman who was harassing him . He said: 'She was eventually\u00a0convicted for harassment \u00a0and now I have a restraining order - that's all I wanted. Now she can't contact me directly or indirectly.' Rav added that if people are concerned about harassment, they shouldn't think they are being silly and should rest assured the police will take them seriously. 'You don't have to put up with it,' he said. 'If you are getting unwanted attention you can go to the police and get action.'", "reference": "Jenna Thomas, 21, was murdered by ex boyfriend\u00a0Philip Packer .\nHe hounded her with calls, texts and visits after they split up .\nThen strangled her to death one day in jealous rage .\nHer twin, Nikki, now wishes they'd taken stalking behaviour more seriously .\nUrges others not to 'put up with' harassment .", "pred_summary": "Nikki Thomas says she wants to turn back the clock to tell Jenna that she didn't have to 'put up' with her former partner's obsessive behaviour.\n'He would ring 300-400 times a day and that was just phone calls.

Stephanie claimed Bobby said 'he was busy with work' and instead sent his assistants to help her. Moved out: The Iron Chef Of America star - pictured in 2013 - is said to have moved out of the couple's New York City apartment . Boiling point: The marriage suffered when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day because he was busy, TMZ reported; Flay was pictured with President Obama in 2009 . In February, the pair didn't celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary together. According to TMZ, Bobby attended a wine festival in Florida with his assistants instead. This will be Stephanie's first divorce and a third for Flay, whose two previous marriages both ended in divorce. In January, Flay was rumoured to be romantically involved with fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis after the 44-year-old Giada At Home star announced her split from her husband of 11 years, Todd Thompson. The Iron Chef Of America star and Giada were spotted having 'a festive dinner out together' at Cecconi's, in the private Soho Beach House, in Miami Beach on December 27, 2014, as People reported. In a statement to Gossip Cop, Giada said that any suggestion of a romance was false. Bobby has a daughter Sophie with second wife Kate Connelly, who he wed in 1995 and divorced in 1999. His first wife is Debra Ponzek, who he wed in 1991 and split from in 1993.

{"article": "Freddie Roach  insisted on Saturday that Floyd Mayweather does not deserve to be ranked alongside Manny Pacquiao as the leading fighters of their generation as the two boxers put the finishing touches to their preparations for the Fight of the Century in Las Vegas a week on Saturday. Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer, said he rated super-middleweight star Andre Ward and middleweight sensation Gennady Golovkin above Mayweather despite the American\u2019s unbeaten record and his status as hot favourite for the May 2 showdown against Pacquiao. \u2018Mayweather is undefeated so you have to give him a little credit for that,\u2019 said Roach, \u2018but he has picked and chosen his opponents and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s fought enough competition to be considered the best. You have to fight the best to be the best, I feel. He\u2019s ducked a lot of guys. Manny Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach says that Floyd Mayweather cannot be considered best ever . Roach says that Mayweather has picked and chosen his fights during his career . \u2018Manny has had some devastating losses in his career but he is a realist. He understands that losing is part of the game and if you don\u2019t think you are going to get knocked out in this sport, you have picked the wrong sport. I\u2019d put Ward and Triple G above Mayweather right now. They are very talented guys and very polished boxers.\u2019 Roach has been vocal in an otherwise low-key and surprisingly respectful build-up to the welterweight showdown next month and knows that his tactics have made the stakes even higher for him. But he is adamant Pacquiao will spring a surprise in the most eagerly awaited fight for years. \u2018The fight will be won and lost on the ropes,\u2019 said Roach. \u2018If Mayweather goes to the ropes and tries to rest his legs, he will get beat. If he has good movement the entire night and his legs don\u2019t give out on him, he\u2019ll probably win. It\u2019s about outscoring him. If he sits on the ropes, we can outscore him. If he stays in the middle of the ring and boxes all the time he could possibly outscore us.\u2019 Roach claimed Pacquiao is in the best shape of his life, moving faster and punching harder than ever before. \u2018He trains harder than any fighter I have ever had in my life,\u2019 said Roach. \u2018I have had 33 world champions and nobody can touch him for his work ethic. His attitude is good. \u2018This fight can send out a message about what we need to do in boxing. When the best fights the best, do you see how big this is? Someone needs to wake up and put the best with the best all the time. Because when that happens, we have the best sport in the world. I don\u2019t care who likes who, you can still negotiate business. Roach rates super middleweight Andre Ward higher than he does undefeated Mayweather . Roach, who has trained Pacquiao for 15 years, says the Filipino is in the best shape of his life . \u2018It\u2019s a better fight today than it was five years ago because they were both a lot faster and more mobile five years ago and it might have been more of a boxing match but now they\u2019re a little bit older, it\u2019s going to be a better fight. \u2018I believe Manny can win this fight. I kind of have to win this fight. I\u2019ve been talking a lot. It\u2019s more important than anything to me. It\u2019s more important to me than getting my girlfriend, Maya, back. It\u2019s that big because, I mean, I really like this girl. \u2018My mother told me, \u201cYou must like her; you put her Christmas tree up for her, you bought her a car and those earrings you bought her cost \u00a314,000 each\u201d. \u2018After this fight maybe I\u2019ll try to get her back.\u2019", "reference": "Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas on May 2 .\nRoach rates Andre Ward and Gennadiy Golovkin above Mayweather .\nMayweather has not fought enough of the competition, says Roach .\nRoach says Pacquiao is in the best shape of his life ahead of fight .", "pred_summary": "Freddie Roach says Floyd Mayweather does not deserve to be ranked alongside Manny Pacquiao.\nThe Filipino's trainer says he rates super-middleweight stars Andre Ward and Gennady Golovkin above Mayweather.\nRoach says that Mayweather has picked and chosen his fights during his career."}

{"article": "A 19-year-old model in California has taken to bathing in pig's blood in a desperate \u2013 and bizarre \u2013 attempt to maintain her youthful appearance \u2013 despite the fact that she is a vegetarian. In the latest episode of\u00a0MTV's True Life, entitled 'I'm Obsessed With Staying Young', freelance model Chanel details her unique skincare method, which she tries to justify by claiming that 'thousands of years ago people did this and it worked'. 'My greatest fear is getting old and developing wrinkles and extra loose skin,' Chanel says. 'So to prevent that from happening I must do whatever it takes.' Scroll down for video . Model of insecurity: 19-year-old Chanel says she is terrified that the effects of aging will stop her modelling career in its tracks . 'I can't stop': Chanel (L) picks up the blood from a local butcher . Chanel insists that, despite her young age, she is already starting to show signs of aging, which she is convinced will soon put a stop to her modeling career altogether. Her desperation to remain looking as young as possible for as long as possible has driven Chanel to a number of extraordinary lengths, most notably covering her body in animal blood , a process she insists will 'keep the skin looking soft and tight'. Her family, skeptical of the benefits ask for proof, but Chanel is unable to offer anything which backs up her bizarre claims. The model also shows off a myriad of other 'beauty fixes' she uses, including a daily shot of garlic powder, balsamic vinaigrette, sage, and olive oil - which she claims helps to 'preserve your body' - as well as a skincare regimen that involves washing her face eight to ten times per day. She also claims to have eaten\u00a0placenta, gone on fasts and put her body through many detoxes in her\u00a0quest to stay young. In the thick of it: Chanel seems unperturbed by the process, dunking her hand into the container of blood and examining the contents before pouring it on to herself . Bloody bizarre: The teenager picked up the blood at a local butcher who asked her if she would prefer pork or beef, to which she replies, 'I don't eat meat' The teen's grandmother, Lois, tries her best to\u00a0dissuade\u00a0Chanel of her latest\u00a0endeavor, saying she could be\u00a0risking her well being. 'I'm sorry my grandmother is worried about my health,' says Chanel. 'But now that I'm this close to my blood bath, I can't stop.' After picking up the pig's blood from a butcher in a large bucket, Chanel climbs into the tub wearing only her underwear and begins pouring the thick, red liquid all over her body. The model, who claims to be a vegetarian, describes how 'even the roughest parts of the body like the elbows feel soft, and I think I owe that to the blood'. Later in the episode, Chanel claims that though she believes the blood bath helped her self-esteem, she 'has no desire to do it again'. Luckily for Chanel, the experience of filming with MTV seems to have had a positive outcome. As she reveals in a follow up Q&A with the channel, she was 'humbled' by the reactions she received. 'I never believed I was that off my rocker,' she adds. 'I think I owe that to the blood': The teenager describes feeling her skin become softer as she soaks in the blood . Other blood bathers: The infamous Countess Elisabeth Bathory was said to have bathed in the blood of virgins to stay young, and the benefits of its use are still championed today by the likes of Kim Kardashian . Although the benefits are not proven, the concept of using blood as a beauty product is far from new. The idea of bathing in blood for youth may have originated with the story of Elisabeth Bathory, a Hungarian Countess who was alleged to have murdered hundreds of young women around the turn of the 16th century. Folklore says that she bathed in the blood of virgins to maintain her youth. Fast-forward to more recent - and less murderous - applications, Kim Kardashian's 'vampire facial' went through a surge in popularity in 2013 after the reality star posted a photo of herself\u00a0receiving\u00a0the treatment, which involves\u00a0drawing a person's own blood, separating the platelets and then injecting it back into the patient's face. A similar new beauty craze involved using a patient's own blood to create a beauty cream, which was recently offered to patrons at the Dorchester Hotel in London.", "reference": "Chanel, from California, appeared on a recent episode of MTV\u2019s True Life .\nIn the video she details her desperate attempts to avoid aging and prolong her modeling career for as long as possible .\nThe teenager also eats placenta and washes her face ten times a day in order to keep her skin wrinkle-free .", "pred_summary": "'My greatest fear is getting old and developing wrinkles and extra loose skin' says the 19-year-old.\nShe claims the process will 'keep the skin looking soft and tight' despite being a vegetarian."}
{"article": "(CNN)Giovanni Lo Porto put himself in harm's way to help, heading to Pakistan to work on a much needed reconstruction project following deadly flooding there. His work and his life, as he knew it then, came to a halt on January 19, 2012. That's when, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency, four armed men burst into the building where Lo Porto lived and abducted him along with colleague Bernd Muehlenbeck. Two years later, Lo Porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a U.S. drone strike, according to American authorities. The native of the Sicilian city of Palermo died along with a fellow al Qaeda hostage, American Warren Weinstein. That same counterterrorism operation in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan killed at least one al Qaeda leader, Ahmed Farouq, who was also a U.S. citizen. His family members, including his four brothers, called him Giancarlo. Lo Porto grew up in Sicily and then studied at London Metropolitan University, getting his undergraduate degree there in Peace and Conflict Studies in 2010, according to the school. A professor there remembers him as \"passionate, friendly (and) open-minded,\" according to an ANSA report. And the university, in a statement, described him as \"a popular student who was committed to helping others.\" \"We are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did,\" the school said. At the time he was taken captive, Lo Porto worked with the German aid organization Welthungerlife, a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. Such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like Multan in Pakistan. That community was one of many in Pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010, which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead. These conditions are all too common in the South Asian nation, as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people, about a quarter of whom were children. \"He told me, 'I'm pleased to have returned to Asia and Pakistan, I love the people, culture and food in this part of the world,' \" said the London Metropolitan University professor. Specifically, Lo Porto was a project manager with Welthungerlife's clean water and sanitation program, working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in October 2011, according to Simone Pott, a spokeswoman for the aid group. Pott described Lo Porto as a lively, very positive man who made friends all over the world. Some of those friends in Italy, England and beyond pressed for Lo Porto's release after he was taken captive, urging Italy's government and newspaper editors to get his story out, ANSA reported. The same story said that al Qaeda (after first claiming he was being held) denied abducting Lo Porto, as did the Pakistani Taliban. Muehlenbeck, a German national, was freed last October, at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated, according to ANSA. But Lo Porto never got the chance to savor freedom again, like his German counterpart. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country's government \"carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return Giovanni to his loved ones.\" \"Unfortunately, the conclusion is now different (than we wanted) because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our American allies, which has been recognized by President Obama,\" Gentiloni said. \"The responsibility of his death and (that) of Warren Weinstein ... is that of the terrorists.\" On Thursday, after the U.S. government reported Lo Porto's death, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed his \"deepest sorrow for the death of an Italian who dedicated his life to the service of others.\" Lo Porto's death left those at his former charity Welthungerlife speechless and confused, Pott said. And then there are his family members like his mother, who ANSA reports became \"another person\" after her son's kidnapping. \"Her only hope was to embrace Giovanni,\" a neighbor said. CNN's Hadia Messia contributed to this report.", "reference": "NGO where Lo Porto works describes him as a lively, positive man with lots of friends .\nLondon university  says he was a \"popular student ... committed to helping others\"\nHe was killed in a U.S. counterterrorism strike in January, authorities say .", "pred_summary": "Giovanni Lo Porto was abducted and killed in Pakistan in 2012.\nU.S. officials say he was killed in a drone strike."}
{"article": "Chamali Fernando, candidate for Cambridge, was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the comment . A Tory parliamentary candidate has sparked outrage after claiming mental health patients should wear coloured wristbands to flag up their conditions. Chamali Fernando, candidate for Cambridge, was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the startling suggestion. She said wearing wristbands indicating a person's condition would help doctors, lawyers and police officers \u2013 because people suffering mental illnesses often struggled to explain themselves. Ms Fernando, a barrister for 12 years, said: 'Police, social services or hospitals dealing with people with conditions that affect their ability to communicate can decide they are being obstructive or evasive. 'They do not realise the person may have a mental health or other condition. The way they behave often affects the way they are treated. 'Carrying some kind of identification shows they have a particular condition so allowances can be made. 'There are also different ways of doing this without stigmatising the person, such as carrying a card with details of the condition but in some cases by wearing a coloured wristband.' Ms Fernando's 'shocking' suggestion was slammed by the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today. Mr Clegg told MailOnline: 'The Liberal Democrats have spent many years campaigning for an end to the stigma around mental health. 'Silly ideas like making people suffering from mental health issues wear wristbands would only increase the discrimination and stigma around mental health, rather than end it.'

Mr Huppert said: 'I have fought hard for many years against the stigma people with mental health problems face. There is already far too much discrimination against mental health throughout our society, and a wristband saying 'I am depressed' is not going to help. 'We need to massively improve mental health support, which has been not good enough for many decades. I hope Chamali regrets her comments and will think carefully about her attitude to mental illness in the future.' Political blogger Richard Taylor reported Ms Fernando's comments at last night's hustings . The Conservative candidate insisted her remarks were 'distorted', adding:\u00a0'It was not that they should wear a wristband. That would be draconian' Ms Fernando has insisted that her comments were 'taken out of context'. She said: 'The question that was asked is how authorities, such as the police, could better deal with mental health issues. 'At Cambridge National Autistic Hustings the chairman of CNAS said he carries a green card in his wallet to identify his condition.

The scars, which usually take the form of a hard lump of tissue and are often larger than the original wound, are most frequently found on the shoulders and neck. Unfortunately, as Mr Vijh pointed out, removal operations frequently make things worse as the body goes into overdrive to heal the new wound. But much to the 18-year-old's relief, he also revealed that keloid removal operations on the ear are among the most likely to be successful. Much better: The teenager is now smiling again after a cosmetic surgeon managed to remove the scar . 'The good news is I can take these lumps away and reconstruct,' he explains. 'But there is a risk the scars could return.' Despite the risk, Remmie chose to go ahead and much to her delight, her ear has been returned to normal. 'My confidence is over the top,' she said afterwards. 'it's so much better. I feel like me again, it's nice to be back.'", "reference": "Remmie, 18, got a piercing across the top of her ear .\nShe hoped it would make her stand out from the crowd .\nWent ahead with piercing against advice of her mother .\nHer body tried to heal the wound by producing scar tissue .\nCreated an unsightly lump known as a keloid scar .\nExtreme Beauty Disasters is on TLC, Thursdays at 8pm .", "pred_summary": "Remmie, 18, had a thick bar put through her ear as an act of teenage rebellion.\nBut when the wound became inflamed, she was forced to remove the bar.\nThe resulting wound healed into a hazelnut-sized lump."}

One of the Muslims on board the rickety craft ordered him to stop, saying: 'Here, we only pray to Allah.' When he refused, a violent fight ensued and 12 Christians drowned when they were thrown overboard by the Muslim refugees.

Refugees: These migrants are among the 10,000 refugees fleeing war and persecution in Africa who have been rescued by Italian ships in the past week . But over 900 making the perilous journey have either died or gone missing since the start of the year and 400 migrants died in two shipwrecks last week. Those who witnessed the African Christians being murdered on the crammed dinghy told investigators how Nigerian Muslims became angry at Christian who started praying. 'They told him that they would throw him overboard if he didn't stop praying to God,' he said, according to La Republica. The witness added:\u00a0'They started shouting, two pushed the lad and he fell in the sea and drowned.' The Muslims 'went mad' and began screaming \"Allah is great\" before they attacked migrants who tried to defend the boy, according to The Times. When 12 migrants were mercilessly thrown overboard, the other Christians formed a human chain and protected themselves against the attackers by clinging to the dinghy. A rescue ship arrived one hour later, according to a Ghanaian witness called Yeboah. Italian police arrested 15 people suspected of the killing including Ousmane Camar from the Ivory Coast.

The fact the football club aren\u2019t doing so sends a very poor message. 'Most of the clubs put money ahead of morality and I think it is disgraceful because it just sends a message out to people that, actually, all they\u2019re interested in is their results, all they\u2019re interested in is winning.\u2019 However, Jim Gilling, secretary of the Coxhoe Supporters\u2019 Group, believes Johnson should be free to play. \u2018It\u2019s the right decision,\u2019 he said. \u2018We have to remember he is not guilty of anything yet. \u2018But the club have left their decision open and it may well be that they reverse it should circumstances change.\u2019 Manager Dick Advocaat supports the club\u2019s stance and admits Johnson is \u2018an important player\u2019 as they fight relegation. But many fans are concerned that the decision has been taken on footballing grounds given the threat to their top-flight status. Steve Dean, secretary of the SAFC Liaison Group, told Sportsmail: \u2018I am very surprised the club did not suspend him. \u2018Going out of the Premier League would cost the club millions of pounds and that is often the first consideration these days.

{"article": "David Cameron will today claim that Labour's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work after Britain was singled out as one of the few 'bright spots' in the global economy. The Prime Minister will vow to encourage more job creation by extending national insurance breaks, worth at least \u00a32,000 a year to smaller firms taking on new staff, for a further five years. Saying he is 'really angry' at Labour's claim that the Conservatives are 'the party for the few, not the many', Mr Cameron will hail the 'jobs miracle' that has seen 1,000 new jobs created every day. David Cameron will today claim that Labour's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work . Contrasting that with Labour's record, he will claim Ed Miliband's economic policies could see 'a million more people joining the dole queues'. Last night, in a boost for George Osborne, the head of the International Monetary Fund picked out the UK recovery as exemplary. Christine Lagarde said the world was suffering from a 'moderate and uneven' return to growth which was 'simply not good enough'. But, in an endorsement of the Government's economic record, she cited the United States and the United Kingdom as countries where the outlook is positive. The comments completed an extraordinary volte-face by the IMF on the Coalition's handling of the economy. Just two years ago, it warned that Mr Osborne was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity \u2013 only to see the economic recovery take off. Britain was the best performing major economy in the developed world last year, with growth of 2.8 per cent. Figures published by the fund also show it has overtaken socialist-run France to become the second most powerful economy in Europe behind Germany. However, the IMF predicted Britain would still be running a deficit at the end of the decade \u2013 despite Tory efforts to balance the books. Cameron will say if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of last Labour government there will be a risk to jobs . Mr Cameron, who dismissed the projections, will today launch a Conservative 'jobs manifesto' setting out plans to bring about 'full employment' \u2013 meaning everyone who wants a job has one. 'We are living through a jobs miracle \u2013 brought to you by a Conservative government that has backed business, reformed welfare and rewarded work,' he will say. Claiming Mr Miliband represents a threat to jobs, he will add: 'You know what makes me really angry? It's when our opponents still go on about 'you Tories \u2013 the party for the few and not the many\u2026' Excuse me? 'This is the party that's taken three million of the lowest-paid workers out of income tax altogether; that's cut the taxes of 26million working people; that's seen 1,000 jobs created every day \u2013 jobs that are giving families security, putting food on tables, helping people out of poverty. 'Under the last five years of Labour, unemployment went up by 600 people a day. 'So if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of the last Labour government \u2013 that he was a part of \u2013 he risks a million more people joining the dole queues.' The jobs manifesto will include a guarantee to maintain the so-called 'employment allowance' until 2020, meaning a third of employers will continue to pay no jobs tax for another five years. The tax break, which helps smaller businesses take on new workers by freeing businesses from at least the first \u00a32,000 of employers' national insurance, has already been taken up by 856,000 firms. David Cameron pictured on a metal platform yesterday (left) and John Major on his soap box in 1992 (right) One of the most abiding images from the 1992 General Election campaign was the moment John Major got on his soap box. And yesterday David Cameron did the same... but gave it a 21st century twist by taking to a folding metal platform. During a campaign stop in Leeds, the Prime Minister raised himself above the closely packed crowd to engage in a question and answer session with employees at the O2 office in Morley and Outwood \u2013 the marginal constituency of shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Major climbed onto an old fashioned soap box in Cheltenham to persuade Conservatives to come out and vote in 1992, just ten days before the election.

They descended on the West Country when a Hudsonian Godwit made a 4,000 mile detour from South America. It is believed the large shorebird - that was heading to its breeding grounds in Canada and Alaska - was last seen in the UK in 1988. The Hudsonian Godwit was spotted at the Shapwick Heath in Somerset and drew scores of bird watchers . More than a thousand bird watchers and photographers lined the water's edge to catch a glimpse of the bird . The wader - with a long beak and spindly legs - is now inhabiting the same space as its English counterparts, the Black Tailed Godwit at the Shapwick Heath, in Somerset. The commotion started when a birdwatcher identified one of the rare birds on the Somerset Levels and word got around. Over the weekend, more than 1,000 twitchers had lined the water's edge. The wader  is now inhabiting the same space as its English counterparts, the Black Tailed Godwit . Photographers line the water's shore to take the perfect shot of the rare bird, only in the UK for the third time . Each spring the Hudsonian Godwit heads from South America to its breeding grounds in Canada and Alaska. In good weather, many birds make the trip south without stopping. A small number migrate in the wrong direction. These birds forage by probing in shallow water. They mainly eat insects and crustaceans. Both parents look after the young birds, who find their own food and are able to fly within a month of hatching. Their numbers were reduced by hunting at the end of the 19th century. One birdwatcher Michael Trew, 70, said word spread about the bird via an online forum at 7.30am yesterday. The retired quantity surveyor said: 'By the time I got there at about 9.30am there was the best part of 200 people there, but about 1,000 had turned up by the time I left. 'I think the last time anyone saw one of these it was about 30 years ago. 'It's not a migrating bird - it's not supposed to be here at all - and we can only assume it is one that has got lost. 'We only think that it has got mixed up in a flock of migrating birds and made its way here. It is quite a strange affair. We don't know how long it has even been here. 'It was spotted by someone who thought 'that one looks a bit different' but these things have to be verified before you get people driving from all over the place to see it. 'Someone came and checked and the word went out about 7.30am. 'I have only been bird watching for five years so it is quite good to have seen one - some people will have waited 30 years.

Other accounts say that some of its former adherents - including Barlow - are turning their backs on the church and changing the towns by setting up public schools and auctioning off property. Scroll down for video . Speaking out:\u00a0Helaman Barlow, who was chief of the bordering towns of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, said he acted on the orders of the church's leader, Warren Jeffs, out of fear of losing his family . The changes are welcome for Barlow, who said he lived in fear that Jeffs and other leaders would take his wife and children away from him if he didn't act as they wanted. After joining the force 20 years ago, Barlow said he quickly learned that officers worked with the church's security unit, known as 'The God Squad'. 'This community has always been a theocracy,' he said.\u00a0'They have a huge network of cameras in this community. They can watch every street.' He told the U.S. Department of Justice that marshals knew of underage marriages that were taking place in the community and failed to do anything to stop it. He said he was also asked by a city official to alter police reports. Locked up: Fundamentalist Church of Latter-Day Saints leader Warren Jeffs, left in his mug shot and right in prison in 2008, is serving life behind bars for marrying and having sex with two underage girls . Former life: Barlow is pictured during his time as police chief but said he has now left the church . Barlow added that when Jeffs was on the run and being sought as one of the FBI's 'Most Wanted', he taped conversations with law enforcement officials and passed them onto Jeffs. 'I knew it was wrong, but it was a way for me to keep my value up,' he told ABC News. He said he acted in ways he now regrets because he feared that his family would be taken away. 'With one phone call, he could call me and say,\"yeah, you're out\",' he said. 'Then he could call [my wife] and say, \"he had no priesthood, he has to go, you have to leave him\".' Barlow said after years of protecting the church, he eventually decided to leave. He has since grown out his hair and his beard to signal that he is turning his back on them. 'I stopped and realized that the religion that I was trying to go to, the church I was trying to attend, was nothing like the church that I was raised in, that I was born into, that I was married in,' he said. Community: The church determines much of the activity in Hildale, Utah, which is seen at the base of Red Rock Cliff mountains, and its sister city, Colorado City, Arizona, in the foreground . 'It was entirely different... then I stopped and went, \"why am I trying to go to a different church than I believe in? I'm done with that\".' Federal investigators are now suing the towns' governments, accusing them of being controlled by the church. In a statement, an attorney for the local governments denied that officials are controlled by the church. Of Barlow, he added: 'We question his credibility, since he repeatedly lied under oath' - an accusation Barlow has not denied.

{"article": "It's the fat-shaming/fit-shaming controversy that's refusing to go away . Online fitness company Protein World caused a Twitter storm recently with its London Underground poster of a genetically-blessed model in a small yellow bikini, asking: 'Are you beach body ready?' The poster, promoting weight loss, came under fire from some feminists and body image campaigners who branded the campaign body-shaming and called for the offending images to be removed. Transport for London are in the process of removing the ad, and now internet pranksters have hit back with their own version of the poster, this time featuring three curvaceous women and featuring the caption: 'Yes. We are beach body ready.' Scroll down for video . 'Yes. We are beach body ready':\u00a0An unknown internet source has recreated the controversial Protein World ad, with curvy alternatives . The original poster, from Protein World, has been subject to much controversy, with many citing it as 'body-shaming' The spoof advert follows the same striking format as the Protein World original, with an eye-catching yellow background and bold font, and is marked up as a Dove product (Dove's real beauty campaign encourages women to appreciate their bodies, regardless of size and shape) but the brand have denied being involved. After being made aware of the copycat image a representative for Dove said:\u00a0The ad was not created by Dove but we do believe that every woman is beach body ready! Dove added: 'In 2004, 75% of women felt advertising and media set unrealistic standards of beauty. Today, that figure is 66%, with the perception being that more diversity is portrayed in the images of women we see around us. 'We have clearly made some progress in the 11 years since Dove started Campaign for Real Beauty but there is still much to do. Two thirds of UK women would prefer to see more women of different weights and shapes, different ages and without digital enhancement in the media. This is why Dove will continue to champion beauty for everyone because looking and feeling your best makes you feel happier.' The image, which was posted on the London underground, is now being removed following complaints . Billboards such as this one, were defaced, as a result of anger from body image campaigners and bloggers . It comes as plus-sized fashion label Simply Be also created its own poster. The parody showing model Jocelyn Corona in a bikini is being displayed at London's Knightsbridge Tube station on Saturday. Protesters are planning to gather  to demonstrate against the original poster. Ms Corona said: 'Every woman has the right to feel comfortable in their own skin. I love being able to show off my curves, so it's great to see brands like Simply Be representing real women in the UK.' Simply Be spokesman Ed Watson said that the controversial Protein World advert was 'at best outdated, at worst insulting'. He said: 'While the Protein World model, Renee, is undeniably beautiful and I'm sure very healthy, it is irresponsible to project something that is largely unachievable as the ideal. 'We need to make people feel great about themselves and this poster does the opposite. 'Because it so literally flew in the face of our ethos of self-acceptance, we wanted to get our message out further, hence taking ad space in one of London's busiest tube stations.' The original yellow billboard image received around 270 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), mostly insisting that it objectified women and that it carried the insinuation that only svelte models were ready to go to the beach. The model in the advert, Renee Somerfield, 24, has spoken out about being body-shamed herself . Various posters were subject to defiant vandalism, with uproar sweeping social media. One billboard was pasted over with a piece of paper which read: 'Your body is fine just as it is. Whatever it looks like, your body is not a commodity. #Everybody'sReady #EverydaySexism' Although fitness company Protein World claims that the image is unPhotoshopped, it clearly touched a nerve, with a further 60,000 outraged people signing an online petition on website Change.org asking Protein World to take down the ads. Interestingly, the 24-year-old model in the ad herself, Australian Renee Somerfield has cited the irony of people getting angry about the 'body-shaming' poster, whilst body-shaming her. In an interview with Huffington Post, the model said: 'I am a real person behind the image. I work very hard and live a healthy and active lifestyle which is why Protein World chose me for their campaign. I couldn't work every day as a full time model by starving myself, dieting or not looking after my body. Nourish your body, be kind to it and it will love you right back, no matter your size.'", "reference": "An unknown internet source has recreated the ad with curvy alternatives .\nDove has denied being responsible for the poster, which carries their logo .\nThe image is currently circulating on social media spoofing the original .\nPlus-sized fashion label Simply Be also created its own poster .", "pred_summary": "Internet pranksters have recreated controversial Protein World ad with Curvy women in bikini.\nAd asked: 'Are you beach body ready?'\nFeminists and body image campaigners branded the campaign body-shaming.\nTransport for London are in the process of removing the ad."}

The 'Cripmas' party, held last December, had white students throwing stereotypical gang symbols while dressed in red and blue bandanas, T-shirts with images of the late rapper Tupac Shakur and fake 'thug' tattoos. The party was also reportedly attended by female students from several sororities. Photos from the party flooded social media and were accompanied by comments such as: 'Merry Cripmas to all, and all a hood night.' The Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity at Clemson University in South Carolina has been put on probation for two years after the group held a Christmas theme party that flared up racial tensions on campus . Clemson University president, James Clements (right), speaks with students protesting last December's frat party which caused outrage for its perpetuation of stereotypes . The party, organized by several SAE members, was held off-campus at a private residence. 'Cripmas' appeared to be a reference to a primarily African-American gang, The Crips, founded in California. The incident caused a backlash as black students protested and said Clemson didn't do enough to promote racial tolerance. About 6 percent of Clemson's students are black. All SAE activity was suspended by Clemson indefinitely following the inappropriate theme party. Several SAE members resigned from positions and have been suspended from the fraternity. An internal investigation found that the fraternity violated alcohol rules and student conduct codes. It will be on probation until February 2017. Clemson University president, James Clements, sent an email to students last December making clear that the party was not sanctioned by the university and that such events would not be tolerated. White students dressed in red and blue bandanas, T-shirts with images of the late rapper Tupac Shakur and sported fake 'thug' tattoos . Clements wrote: 'At a time of year when our thoughts are turning to family, holidays and the start of a new year \u2013 all the things that unite us and bring us joy -- it is discouraging that so many events and issues are causing division and hurt, and making many students feel unwanted at this great university. 'It hurts to read disrespectful and just plain mean comments in social media. Last night's ''Cripmas'' party, which the university did not sanction, raised more concerns about the campus climate. Clemson is better than this. He added: 'Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion about events in Ferguson, Staten Island and the protest rallies that those events have spawned. Great universities are built on the free expression and exploration of ideas. 'But the free expression of opinion must not cross the line and become harassment or intimidation, just as rallies and protest marches must not cross the line to lawlessness.' A Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was disbanded last month after members were taped singing a racist song.

{"article": "Paul Casey insists he is desperate to play in the Ryder Cup again, even though he looks unlikely to rejoin the European Tour in time to earn qualifying points this season. Only Tour members can play on the team and Phoenix-based Casey gave up his membership after deciding in January to concentrate on the PGA Tour in order to get back into the world's top 50. The move has paid off with the former world No 3 losing a play-off in the Northern Trust Open and finishing joint third in the Honda Classic to climb to 44th at the start of this week. Paul Casey, practicing ahead of the Masters in Augusta, 'desperately' wants to return to the Ryder Cup . The Englishman has returned to the world's top 50 after leaving the European Tour to concentrate on his game . However, even if he rejoins the European Tour before the May 1 deadline to be eligible to accrue Ryder Cup points when the race starts in August, he will struggle to play the 13 events required for membership. 'It was very straightforward when I was top 10 in the world playing both tours,' Casey told Sportsmail ahead of his first Masters appearance since 2012. 'I know I am back in the top 50 but I have only just got back into the top 50. It was a very difficult decision but it was also the correct decision. 'I still have to play 13 events and right now I am not in the US Open or Open or HBSC Champions at the end of the year. Playing 13 becomes difficult when you haven't played at the start of the year in Middle East.' Casey celebrates while watching a replay of his hole-in-one, which helped Europe to victory in 2006 . Casey last played in the Ryder Cup competition in the 2008 defeat by USA at Valhalla . Casey played in the record Ryder Cup wins in 2004 and 2006 and the 2008 defeat at Valhalla, but was in tears after being overlooked for a wild card by captain Colin Montgomerie in 2010, when he was ranked seventh in the world. 'I desperately want to be part of a Ryder Cup again. There is definitely passion and a fire there burning,' he added. 'Certainly one of them I felt like I was maybe denied, the others I haven't been in a position to make the team and watching Medinah and Gleneagles has been brilliant. 'What they have done has been absolutely phenomenal and I want to be part of that again and not just part of it, but a real solid team player and leader in the team room, which I know I can be. When I play my best golf I think I can certainly play that kind of role.' European captain Darren Clarke said earlier this week he wanted Casey on his team for Hazeltine next year, and the 37-year-old added: 'Paul (McGinley) said the same thing (even though I was a member of the Tour at the time). 'He was desperate for me to be part of that because I had won twice around Gleneagles and unfortunately wasn't playing the golf I needed to.' Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right), speaking with Tiger Woods in Augusta, wants Casey on his team . Casey finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and is relishing being back at Augusta National after failing to qualify in 2013 and 2014. 'When you have been here and gone away for a year or two you certainly appreciate it when you come back,' he added. 'I'm very focused this week but I am enjoying being here and lapping up everything about it. 'I was on the same flight as Padraig Harrington (who was also ineligible last year) on Sunday and when we landed the girls who run the courtesy car service here had all made little signs saying 'Welcome back Padraig'.

O'Connor's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year and came comfortably inside the World Championships qualification mark of 2:10:20. Hannah Miley took the silver medal with a time of 2:11:65 and Aimee Willmott claimed bronze in 2:13:30. Siobhan-Marie O'Connor celebrates with second-placed Hannah Miley (left) and third-placed Aimee Willmott . O'Connor, who is the reigning Commonwealth champion, was short of her 2:08.21 personal best - a British record - but said making the team for Russia was her main focus. 'I'm chuffed, the (qualifying) times are a massive challenge but it means everyone has to step up and race world class times,' O'Connor said. 'I'm really just happy to have made the team. It was really tough. I'm happy with that time, I just wanted to go under 2.10. 'I would have ideally liked to have been closer to my personal best but sometimes you're not on your best form. To get the qualifying time was my main aim.' O'Connor's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year . The performance of O'Connor, who won 100m freestyle gold on Tuesday, is particularly impressive considering the heavy disruptions to her winter training programme. The pool at the University of Bath, where the 19-year-old has trained for most of her career, has been closed for six months renovation meaning she and her group have been forced to relocate 32 miles away at Millfield School. 'It has been hard over the last six months,' O'Connor added. 'It has been a challenge but everyone has challenges in sport. 'It's just something we have to deal with. It couldn't have been any better and I'm proud to have adapted to it. 'It's definitely been tough, we've all felt that. Our pool is open in Bath after this though so I'm looking forward to getting back there and getting some consistency again.' The 19-year-old claimed two titles despite heavy disruptions to her winter training programme . Jazz Carlin followed up her success in the 400m freestyle on Wednesday with a dominant performance in the 800m freestyle to win another gold medal. Carlin clocked 8:21:58 which was enough to seal the title but she missed the World Championships qualifying time of 8:21:22. The Commonwealth and European champion is still likely to race the 800m in Russia, after finishing more than 10 seconds clear of Jessica Thielmann (8:32:19) in second and Camilla Hattersley in third (8:37:99). 'I'm not too disappointed to miss the qualifying time,' Carlin said. 'For myself I would have liked to have gone quicker but to make the worlds qualifying time yesterday I'm sure I'll get to swim the event there. 'It felt a bit tough tonight, I didn't really get into it, I felt a bit heavy in my stroke but that happens.'

Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday . Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage . Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here . Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland . Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches. Spain are second on 12 points, three ahead of Ukraine, who they beat 1-0 in Seville on Friday. Del Bosque's side host Slovakia in September in a match that could decide who goes through to the finals as group winners. 'The team is in good shape,' forward Pedro told reporters.

A police official, Deputy Inspector General Kantha Rao, declined comment Wednesday, saying an \"investigation is still going on.\" The incident in question took place early Tuesday in India's southeastern Andhra Pradesh state. Forest officials near the town of Tirupati spotted hundreds of smugglers cutting trees for red sandalwood, Rao said Tuesday. The forest officials, who were unarmed, called for police. \"We saw several trees chopped down,\" Rao said said. \"These guys came prepared and were heavily armed.\" Rao said that the ensuing gun battle lasted more than three hours and 20 smugglers were shot. Many of them came from the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu, he said. Amnesty International said the police were claiming self-defense, alleging the suspects attacked them with stone and axes. \"However, no police official was injured,\" the  Amnesty statement said. \"Most of the suspected smugglers were shot in the back.\" According to Amnesty, India's National Human Rights Commission has said the incident \"involved a serious violation of human rights of the individuals,\" and that \"the opening of firing cannot be justified on the ground of self defense since it resulted in the loss of lives of 20 persons.\" The commission has asked senior government and police officials to explain the actions of the police and forest officials within two weeks, Amnesty said.

Insurance giant Admiral said many youngsters addicted to their mobile phones lose out at the very beginning of looking for work - because they failed to string a normal sentence together. Forms saying: 'U r a gr8 company 2 work 4' and 'Btw am out of work atm' are examples hitting their job chances. Young job seekers fill forms with text speak such as\u00a0'U r a gr8 company 2 work 4' and 'Btw am out of work atm' The Cardiff-based insurer with more than 5,000 staff voiced their fears in evidence to the Welsh Assembly's Enterprise and Business Committee that many youngsters failed at the application form stage. An Admiral spokesperson said: 'We do not ask for any formal qualifications, but we expect the spelling and grammar on the application form to be of a certain standard. 'A lot of it is like text-speak, there is no punctuation or upper case. So, that is the first impression that you get.'

Alexander Bradley told Bristol County Superior Court Justice Susan Garsh he would be able to testify that Hernandez had access to the type of pistol he is accused of using to murder semipro football player Odin Lloyd, but not about a separate 2013 incident in which Bradley contends Hernandez shot him in the face. Hernandez, 25, is charged with killing Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister. Lloyd was found shot dead in June 2013 in an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. During one sidebar Bradley stared directly at Hernandez, who refused to make eye contact . Scroll down for video . Alexander Bradley (above) appeared in Bristol County Superior Court on Wednesday for Justice Susan Garsh to decide what he could testify to in front of a jury in the Aaron Hernandez murder trial . Bradley, who says he was Hernandez's (above) former drug dealer and then his best friend, cannot reveal his claim that Hernandez shot him in the eye . Bradley, who has sued Hernandez over a February 2013 shooting incident, will be allowed to tell jurors he saw someone hand Hernandez a black Glock pistol in a Miami hotel. 'Another gentleman passed a firearm to Mr. Hernandez,' said Bradley. 'It appeared to be a Glock.' The murder weapon in the case has not been recovered, but prosecutors have said it was a black Glock pistol. The gun Bradley will testify about 'could have been, might have been, the murder weapon,' Garsh said. Bradley told the judge he was Hernandez's marijuana dealer before they became friends, and described the football star as a 'chain smoker' who bought the drug in quantities of up to 4 ounces  at a time. Later, he said, Hernandez became one of his 'best friends.' According to a civil lawsuit filed by Bradley last year, the friendship came to an end during a late night dispute in February 2013, when he claims Hernandez shot him in the face, causing him to lose his right eye. Bradley never filed a criminal complaint. He also said that Hernandez once said Lloyd was 'rude' in passing after the way he ignored the former footballer at his own home. Bradley will be allowed to tell jurors he saw someone hand Hernandez a black Glock pistol (similar to the one above) in a Miami hotel . Prosecutors have contended the February incident is relevant to the Lloyd murder since it shows that Hernandez had no trouble shooting his friends. The defense has argued that Hernandez would not have killed Lloyd because of their friendship. During questioning before testifying to the jury, Bradley said Hernandez often told him he had a hard time trusting people and believed that some of his friends were ungrateful for the things he did. Garsh ruled that Bradley could testify to those points. But the judge blocked Bradley from testifying that Hernandez was 'unreasonably suspicious' and would not allow Bradley to use iPhones around him, or that Hernandez believed he was being tailed by police cruisers and helicopters. The defense meanwhile worked to discredit Bradley, who they said did not mention the gun to a grand jury, once claimed he never sold drugs to Hernandez and has a long list of pending charges against him, among them\u00a0assault, burglary, reckless endangerment, and multiple gun charges.

Three weeks ago Mr Byrnes was told by doctors that he had a stage four brain tumour that was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jackson Byrnes (pictured) is less than a day away from accumulating enough money to pay for life-saving brain surgery .

According to the\u00a0Gold Coast Bulletin, Mr Byrnes' girlfriend, Jahnae Jackson, noticed he had developed a limp a mere three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI. He was rushed to the Gold Coast for a biopsy which found a stage four tumour buried deep in the teenager's brain. Mr Byrnes was told they would not operate due to how deep the cancer was, but instead suggested chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

After a week of campaigning online, the Casino teenager is nearly there with less than a day to go . Knowing that this was not enough, Mr Byrnes and his family searched for a specialist who would perform the dangerous procedure. They found neurosurgeon Charlie Teo who would operate on Wednesday as long as he received an upfront payment of $80,000 by Tuesday evening. The family then turned to social media and crowd sourcing in a desperate plea for donations.

{"article": "Washington (CNN)A year after ISIS became a household name in America, using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge al Qaeda and its affiliates for jihadist adherents, U.S. prosecutions of would-be recruits have exploded. The flurry of arrests -- at least 25 people have been detained since January -- is a sign that complicated, manpower-intensive investigations begun when ISIS started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed. But they also highlight the unique challenges that ISIS poses in comparison with al Qaeda, which has attracted fewer U.S.-based recruits. Like a new rock band storming the music charts, ISIS has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda, law enforcement officials said. The group quickly reached early recruits through videos that showcased the fear its adherents instilled in nonbelievers. At first, most of the recruits were self-starters -- people radicalized on their own from consuming ISIS propaganda from YouTube videos and other social media. Much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailer-style videos, some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who ISIS leaders decide doesn't comport with their medieval brand of Islam. But once those initial Western recruits arrived, living in the self-declared ISIS caliphate spanning parts of Syria and Iraq, they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them. In Minnesota, nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to American Abdi Nur, who turned up fighting with ISIS in Syria in 2014 and began to appeal to his friends to come to the Middle East. \"Each one of those folks who makes it over there has the capability to reach out back to their contacts back here,\" a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said. It's a phenomenon observed in Norway and other European nations, where clusters of young people have been lured to ISIS. And the ISIS recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than al Qaeda has had. A decade ago, that group's recruits faced formidable obstacles trying to get to training camps deep in hard-to-reach areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal region. Few Westerners went through the trouble. Minneapolis men allegedly trying to join ISIS highlight role of American recruiter . Today, ISIS occupies much more accessible territory, mostly reachable through Turkey. Istanbul's airport has easy connections to Western Europe and much of the rest of the world. From there, Turkey's modern infrastructure offers quick access to the border regions where smugglers can help jihadis get across to Syria. The informal recruitment networks and ease of travel have presented a difficult puzzle to intelligence and counterterrorism officials, who are used to tracking networks of facilitators and fundraisers that funnel recruits eastward. \"It's harder for us to pick up on,\" the U.S. counterterrorism official said of the peer-to-peer recruitment, which is well below the radar. How ISIS is luring Westerners . Before ISIS, investigators could often focus on radicalizing mosques and clerics to figure out those networks. Al Qaeda recruitment focused on attracting radicals who were motivated to join the fight to protect Islamic holy lands. Much of the recruitment occurred in countries with strong conservative Islamic histories, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen, U.S. officials said. In contrast, ISIS takes a somewhat secular approach, portraying how much better life purportedly is in the caliphate as compared to the corrupt West. And people attracted to ISIS' marketing run the gamut from rich to poor, educated to dropout, male to female, teenaged to middle-aged. There are signs Western recruits have risen to high levels in the ISIS organization, with their influence reflected in the latest propaganda, counterterrorism and intelligence officials said. The English is proper, with fewer grammatical and spelling mistakes. And while the large number of arrests show that law enforcement officials are succeeding in their disruption efforts, it also means that U.S. authorities don't see the lure of ISIS receding any time soon. \"We are opening cases quicker than we are closing them,\" the U.S. counterterrorism official said.

{"article": "Sergeant Edwin Mee, 46, has been accused of\u00a0raping and molesting 11 young women who wanted to join the forces . A war veteran who swapped the battlefield for a 'dull' job as an army recruiter 'raped young hopefuls because it made the job more exciting', a court heard today. Sergeant Edwin Mee, 46, is said to have abused his position of power while interviewing applicants by raping and molesting 11 young women who wanted to join the forces. The officer - known as 'Jock' - allegedly carried out the attacks on women aged from 15 to their early twenties between October 2010 and September 2011 at an Army careers centre in Croydon. The alleged victims, who were desperate for jobs, were often new to the country and unaware of their rights, Southwark Crown Court heard. Mee, who has served in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration relating to 11 young cadets. Jurors were told earlier in the trial that one of the women, a virgin in her early 20s, fell pregnant after Mee raped her in a locked waiting room. An 18-year-old from Sierra Leone also claimed Mee raped her after saying he could help her get a visa. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC suggested\u00a0'risk taker' Mee who has fought in war zones across the world found interviewing recruits in Croydon 'dull'. 'But if he could use his position and manipulate it to take small risks at first and then bigger ones, it would make the job that much more exciting,' she said. 'Bullying, talking dirty to the young women, smacking bottoms and ultimately raping young women - he got away with it for a year or more. 'He obviously believed he would never get caught.' She said Mee believed he was the only 'real soldier' at the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office in Croydon, south London. 'This case starts and finishes with Sergeant Jock, are you sure that he behaved the way the prosecution said or not - he is right at the centre of it all,' she said. He was British Army recruiting sergeant at Mitcham Barracks in Croydon (pictured) in the Careers and Information Office . 'He, of course, says he didn't do any of the violating, bullying and humiliating acts alleged against him. 'But there appears to be no good reason, or any reason, why any one of these women would lie - let alone 11 of them. 'What have you made of the evidence he gave and of the man whom you are going to be sitting in judgement? 'He is a man who is proud of his record in active service.' Jurors were told Mee thought little of his fellow recruiters, even if they were senior to him. 'He was the real soldier, he was the one who believed that he had the right to recruit those who would join the British Army,' said Ms Cottage. 'You may feel that was his attitude.\u00a0With his promotion towards the end of 2010 did he come to believe in his own importance? 'Was he arrogant enough to believe that when he behaved in the way he did again and again with woman after woman that he had become so important within that office that they would not complain and even if they did, nobody else would believe them?' Mee, originally from Glasgow, joined the army when he was 24 and went on to serve tours of duty in Iraq - where he was attached to the Special Forces. By the time the allegations against him came to light he had acquired the rank of sergeant, and he was suspended in 2011. The court was told that Mee was medically discharged from the Army in April 2014. The alleged offences were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police, before the case was then handed to the Metropolitan Police. The trial continues.

{"article": "Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)As soon as the buses parked, the people scrambled onto the airport tarmac. They carried duffel bags, plastic bags full of clothes and small suitcases. They'd already abandoned larger bags in a mound. Only carry-on luggage was allowed on this Air India plane. The passengers were mostly Indian nationals, plus Yemenis and people from other countries who had been working in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. They sprinted or walked with deliberation to the airplanes. The stress of living in a war zone showed on the passengers' faces. Nobody wanted to be left behind. They climbed the steps to the airliner and were greeted by the Air India crew, all wearing pressed uniforms, the flight attendants fully made up. After takeoff, the flight attendants went up and down the aisle offering drinks to the 188 evacuees as if they were on a vacation flight. But some passengers were already fast asleep, exhausted by the push to get out of Yemen, site of some of the most chaotic fighting in the Mideast. This scene has been repeated in recent days as countries work to get their citizens out of Sanaa during a small window when Saudi planes are not bombing the city in an attempt to drive out the Houthis, a Shiite group that has taken over the capital. Air India is especially active because so many Indian nationals work in other nations. Over the last few days, India has evacuated some 2,500 people from Yemen, said Gen. Vijay Kumar Singh, the Indian deputy foreign minister who's overseeing the evacuation. The flights are going to Djibouti, the small African nation nearly 430 kilometers (267 miles) away. Some evacuees are fleeing on boats at port cities such as Aden. People are leaving behind much more than luggage. Damodar Thakur, a professor at Sanaa University, lived in the capital 34 years and built a life there. He loved living in Yemen. \"I never felt like a foreigner,\" he said. Like the others, he was exhausted and jangled by the shelling and lack of electricity for long stretches. \"At night, my goodness!\" he said. \"Gunshots being fired every minute. Sometimes the sky full of sparkling lights. Some women crying, children terrified. Really bad.\" The Houthi rebels control Sanaa, including the airport. But the Saudis are bombing the city and thus control air access in a way, so getting people out requires coordination. The Saudi air force gave Air India a four-hour window to go to and from Sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing. As the plane approached the city, the crew could see the scars of the fighting. There were no cars on the roads. Dozens of buildings were destroyed. At the airport, the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by Saudi bombs, but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits. The loading of passengers was swift. They approached the planes carrying boarding passes -- another touch of normalcy in the otherwise abnormal event. They didn't  pay for the flight, though they had to purchase exit visas from the Houthis. Children sat on their parents' laps to maximize the number of people on the plane. Some passengers fell asleep as soon as they took their seats before takeoff. Everyone seemed to carry the weight of war, especially nurses who had tended the wounded.

Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary, \"and I don't really care to.\" \"I've been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative,\" Travolta said. The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's most high-profile members along with stars like Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley, is premiering his new film, \"The Forger,\" in Clearwater, Florida. The HBO documentary is based on the book \"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief\" by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization, which has close ties to the showbiz industry. Travolta said he believed the doc was a result of \"people who were disgruntled with their experiences\" with the Church of Scientology, which he touted as a positive experience for him. \"I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?\" Travolta asked. \"It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom (Cruise), I imagine.\" He called Scientology \"brilliant\" and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son, Jett, after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the Bahamas in 2009. \"Oh, my God, I wouldn't have made it,\" said Travolta, whose wife, Kelly Preston, is also a member. \"Honestly.\"", "reference": "The actor says he's not planning on seeing the buzzed-about documentary .\nHe called Scientology \"brilliant\"\nTravolta credits the church with helping him deal with his son's death .", "pred_summary": "Travolta tells the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary.\n\"I've been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years,\" he says."}

{"article": "Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson has been filmed lashing out at an aggressive AFL fan after his team's narrow loss to Port Adelaide on Saturday night. The footage shows a young man, thought to be an Adelaide Power fan, taunting Clarkson as he made his way back to his Adelaide hotel room, before Clarkson pushes the man and grabs his neck. It appears the video was captured by a friend of the young man and it's understood the pair had been goading Clarkson in the lead-up to the confrontation. Scroll down for video . Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson was filmed lashing out at a young man, thought to be an Adelaide Power fan after his team's loss on the weekend . Alastair Clarkson was approached by the fan as he made his way back to his Adelaide hotel room. The man reportedly 'got in his face' yelling 'Hey Clarko, how was the win today brother?' In the video, which was provided to Channel Seven, the fan is seen shouting in the face of the Hawks coach. 'Hey Clarko, Clarko, how was the win, how was the win today brother? Goooo the Power! An agitated Clarkson lashes out at the man before grabbing him by the throat. The incident took place in the hours after the Hawthorn Hawks' narrow eight-point loss to Port Adelaide. Hawthorn CEO Stuart Fox, who saw the incident unfold, has described it as 'very unfortunate.' 'Alastair was walking back to the hotel with our general manager of football Chris Fagan and came across some intoxicated boys and Clarko was certainly harassed,' Fox said in an interview with Fox Sports. 'He politely declined to be photographed and videoed and the boys just got in his face and tried to get Clarko into the hotel and it was one of those issues that got a little bit ugly. It's not known whether the man in the video was a Power supporter as he wasn't wearing any Port Adelaide clothing. Port Adelaide CEO Keith Thomas said those responsible would be held accountable if found to be club members. 'If it is a Port Adelaide member \u2026 we'll be acting pretty aggressively about that,' Thomas told Fox Sports. Hawks coach Alastair Clarkson, pictured, was 'pushed and shoved all the way to the door,' says Hawthorn CEO . It's not the first altercation the Hawthorn coach has been involved in. In 2006 Clarkson was fined $5000 for abusing umpires on board a plane and in 2008 he was fined for criticising umpire Justin Schmitt\u2019s performance which involved a defeat to Geelong. But Hawthorn's Stuart Fox and others in the AFL community have voiced their support of Clarkson, saying he was 'harassed.' Fox said the video missed the minute prior to the incident where Clarkson and Chris Fagan declined photographs with the two fans and tried to get themselves to the hotel room. 'They were pushed and shoved all the way up to the door and, unfortunately, Clarko's pushed back and got himself in the hotel and gone straight to bed' Fox said. Fox said the incident draws attention to the lack of security at the hotel. He said\u00a0the club has contacted the AFL to seek clarification on post-game security procedures. In 2006, Clarkson was fined $5000 for abusing umpires on a flight and in 2008 he was fined for criticising umpire's performance over a defeat to Geelong .

{"article": "A professor testifying in a cold-case trial in Southern California said Thursday that she was intimidated into identifying her rapist to the man now charged with killing him in 1995. Norma Esparza, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and agreed to testify, said from the stand that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, now 45, was outraged when he heard about the assault and demanded that she find and point out Gonzalo Ramirez at the bar where she met him. Van is now charged with the murder of Ramirez. Prosecutors allege Van and friends kidnapped and beat Ramirez and left him by the roadside. 'I was intimidated': Norma Esparza, pictured here during a press conference in 2013, testified Thursday at the murder trial of ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, 45, who is charged with killing a man in 1995 she claims raped her. She says Van intimidated her into identifying the murder victim,\u00a0Gonzalo Ramirez . Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . 'We were sitting around a booth next to an entrance or exit, and at some point I see Gonzalo Ramirez walk by,' Esparza said of the night in 1995, according to the Orange County Register. 'When I see him, I cringe,' she said, showing how she reacted by bending her head down and putting her face in her hands. 'I didn't want to see him again.' Esparza, testifying in the trial's second day, said she was 'broken' by the assault, that Van was directing his anger not just at her attacker but at her, and that she did not know what Van and his friends would do once she pointed out Ramirez. 'He would just insult me,' she said. 'He would rant and just be explosive.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in Europe and the mother of a little girl (left). Esparza is pictured right upon her arrest while re-entering the U.S. in 2012 . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client had no role in the murder and knew nothing of any plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza \u2014 who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France \u2014 was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from advocates for sexual assault victims who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. Esparza, 40, is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. During opening statements this week, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that. Involved? The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran (center) \u00a0and Tran's wife Diane Tran (right) as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries (left). Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.'

{"article": "Obock, Djibouti (CNN)Amina Ali Qassim is sitting with her youngest grandchild on her lap, wiping away tears with her headscarf. Only a few months old, this is the baby girl whose ears she desperately tried to cover the night the aerial bombardment started. She lay awake, she says, in a village mosque on the Yemeni island of Birim, counting explosions as the baby cried. It could have been worse though. They could have still been in their house when the first missile landed. \"Our neighbor shouted to my husband 'you have to leave, they're coming.' And we just ran. As soon as we left the house, the first missile fell right by it and then a second on it. It burned everything to the ground,\" Qassim tells us. Qassim and her family fled Birim at first light, piling in with three other families. Twenty-five of them squeezed into one boat setting sail through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to Djibouti. Bab al-Mandab is one of the busiest waterways in the world, a thoroughfare for oil tankers and cargo ships. It's now being crossed by desperate Yemenis in rickety fishing boats seeking refuge from the conflict threatening to engulf their country. Qassim's son Mohamed describes the families' journey across this part of the Red Sea as \"a window into hell.\" \"The women were violently ill,\" he tells us. \"It was a catastrophe.\" It took them five hours to cross into the north of Djibouti, where the government is providing the refugees with temporary shelter in this unfinished orphanage here in Obock. And the U.N. says thousands more refugees are expected. Qassim and her family will soon have to move to the plastic tents that have been prepared for them on the dusty outskirts of the town, taking with them only the collection of plastic mats and pots neatly stacked in the corner. It's all that remains of everything they once owned. Her two daughters are trapped back in Yemen, in Taiz. She hasn't been able to reach them and the worry she says is almost unbearable. I ask her how many days it was after the Saudi aerial bombardment began that they left. She looks at me and laughs, \"How many days would you have stayed?\" Then she goes quiet, looking down at the granddaughter in her lap. Finally she tells me, \"I thought she would never be able to stop screaming. That the fear would stay with her forever.\" \"May God please have mercy on Yemen.\"", "reference": "Amina Ali Qassim's family sought shelter in a mosque before fleeing Yemen .\nThousands like them are boarding boats to sail to Djibouti .\nSaudi Arabia has been pounding Yemen in a bid to defeat Houthi rebels .", "pred_summary": "Yemenis fleeing to Djibouti in rickety fishing boats are fleeing across the Bab al-Mandab Strait to safety.\nThe U.N. says thousands more refugees are expected."}

{"article": "Binge drinking might seem like a uniquely modern phenomenon - but in fact it is a time-honoured tradition, according to health experts. Ancient civilisations such as the Romans, Greeks and Egyptians have had to deal with rowdy, drunken behaviour in public for thousands of years. Now one academic suggests that modern authorities should take a lead from their forebears as they attempt to mitigate the impact of our boozy culture. Party: This relief from Herculaneum shows Bacchus, the god of wine, with followers at a frenzied gathering . Contrast: Health experts have compared ancient nights out to modern drinking spots such as Magaluf . Mark Bellis, who is honorary professor of public health at Bangor University, is giving a talk at a conference in Las Vegas this week about the history of binge drinking. In his lecture, entitled 'Lessons from the history of nightlife - 10,000 years from Mesopotamia to Vegas', he will examine how our distant ancestors balanced freedom with responsiblity in regulating nightlife. He told the Independent: 'We think we're discovering the problems of nightlife for the first time, but these have been with us for a long time. 'There's always been a tension in history: people want a safe night out, but they also demand freedom and an element of anonymity.' Vessel: A Greek amphora which could have been used for holding the wine which was drunk in large quantities at feasts . Many of the concerns of the ancient authorities were strikingly similar to ours, according to Dr Bellis. In Pompeii - where one of the best-preserved buildings after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is a tavern - city officials installed street lights, only to face opposition from drinkers who were worried about sacrificing their privacy. The Greeks launched wide-scale campaigns to dissuade drunkenness, with playwrights using gods in their productions to warn against alcohol abuse. And in Egypt, one of the major concerns was mixing drink and drugs, as many locals would consume a narcotic flower called 'blue lotus' while knocking back beer, Dr Bellis says. He told the Independent: 'People look for an escape from the social and behavioural constraints of the day. That's what night has always been about.' The official preview of his talk, set to take place tomorrow, reads: 'The foundations of modern nightlife go back thousands of years to when people first abandoned nomadic lives to build and live in cities. 'Since then, countless cultures have added their own innovations and regulations in attempts to balance safety and security with excitement and anonymity. 'Looking back at how nightlife developed over the past 10,000 years, we can learn from history's successes and failures and develop a greater insight into the challenges posed by nightlife today.' The use of alcohol goes back to the Stone Age, and almost all societies around the world have made some sort of drink - despite the problems that come with a booze culture. Some of the earliest written texts, from Mesopotamia, make reference to alcohol - the law code of Hammurabi, from 1750 BC, contains regulations stopping tavern landlords from ripping off their customers. The Epic of Gilgamesh shows the eponymous king promising to distribute beer and wine to his followers 'like the new year celebrations'. Many aspects of Greek culture were centred around drinking - one of Plato's best-known texts is the Symposium, set at a huge drinking party, while wine even had its own deity in the form of Dionysus. However, to avoid excess drinkers were advised to water down their wine with water, and to drink more water between each cup of alcohol. Warning: Gin Lane, by William Hogarth, graphically depicted the dark side of booze culture . The Roman love of drinking is shown by the preserved city of Pompeii, where one of the buildings buried by volcanic ash in the eruption of Vesuvius appears to have been an inn. Rowdy feasts were also part of Anglo-Saxon society, as seen in the epic poem Beowulf, which could be a cautionary tale as it features the monster Grendel carrying off warriors who were tired out from a night of carousing. The Islamic world attempted to eliminate the problem of drunkenness with a religious ban on alcohol, but there are signs that this did not always work. The 900-year-old Persian poem known as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam opens with an appeal for 'a jug of wine, a loaf of bread' to accompany an idyllic and romantic landscape. One tactic used to tackle alcohol abuse was to substitute less strong drinks instead of spirits - for example, in the Georgian era William Hogarth published two prints contrasting the hellish 'Gin Lane' with the relaxed and peaceful 'Beer Street'.", "reference": "Health expert Mark Bellis says alcohol abuse goes back as far as ancient civilisations such as the Greeks and Mesopotamians .\nThe Egyptians used to warn against mixing alcoholic drinks with drugs .\nAuthorities tackled public drunkenness with street lights and advertising .", "pred_summary": "Binge drinking is a time-honoured tradition across the world.\nAncient civilisations had to deal with rowdy, drunken behaviour in public.\nMark Bellis will talk at a conference in Las Vegas this week about the history of binge drinking."}

A bizarre search is now unfolding on Queensland's Gold Coast as authorities try to locate the reptile which could pose a threat to local wildlife and even people's pet cats and dogs. Snake catcher Tony Harrison warned that if the large-predatory boa has Inclusion Body Disease 'it can be unbelievably contagious if that gets loose in Australia'. Mr Harrison told Daily Mail Australia: 'Police should have called the snake catchers and we'd have euthanised it. That was very silly of them.' Scroll down for video .

The officers released the reptile into bushland at the Southport Spit, but the incident has since sparked an operation by Biosecurity Queensland officers who say the snake isn't a harmless python after all. Mr Harrison believes the snake - likely to be an illegal import that was kept as a pet - will be found 'within a month' but there are fears if the boa is pregnant there could then be up to 30 live young on the loose.

'Of course I want to continue to serve the country and serve my party, which I am so proud to have served for seven or eight years now.\u2019 He added: \u2018I want to lead the Liberal Democrats into and through the next Parliament in all circumstances. \u2018All I am focused on at the moment is sounding the alarm about the very, very real risk that as the Labour Party and Conservative Party vacate the centre ground and hare off in which direction after another, there is a very real risk we undo all the sacrifices and hard work that have gone in over the last five years to put the country back on track economically.\u2019 Meet and greet: Mr Clegg (far right) speaks to voters and their families during a General Election campaign visit to Sutton with Paul Burstow (second right) the party's candidate for Sutton and Cheam .

{"article": "(CNN)Two years ago, the storied Boston Marathon ended in terror and altered the lives of runners, spectators and those who tried to come to their rescue. Just last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 charges related to the bombings at the race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. The jury will begin deliberating his punishment next week. The death penalty is on the table. Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police, were intent on terrorizing not just Bostonians, but all Americans, prosecutors said. But the Tsarnaevs were not on the minds of most people in Boston on Wednesday. The injured victims and those who lost their lives were spoken of with reverence in somber ceremonies. Relatives of 8-year-old Martin Richard, the attack's youngest victim, and the family of Krystle Campbell  stood with Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin Walsh. Bagpipes played and banners whipped in the wind on Boylston Street, the Boston Globe reported. Boston University graduate student Lingzi Lu also was killed in one of the two horrific blasts that brought chaos to the competitors and spectators near the race's finish line on April 15, 2013. Who were the victims? Many bombing survivors were in the crowd for Wednesday's events, the newspaper said. They wore white, blue and yellow pins celebrating \"One Boston Day,\" which was created to recognize acts of valor and to encourage kindness among Bostonians. Many there and those who couldn't observe the day in person tweeted their respect and memories using #BostonDay. The marathon historically happens on a Monday. This year, runners will take on the 26.2 mile challenge April 20. \"I think today will always be a little emotional for me -- Marathon Monday is my favorite day of the year, and will continue to be, despite these tragedies,\" Boston resident Lindsey Berkowitz told CNN. \"I have so much respect and support for all of the survivors, and hope the city continues to come together on this day to embrace the strength and resilience of Boston, and the love we all have for this great city.\" Melanie DiVasta was working just a mile from the finish line in 2013 when one of the bombs set by the Tsarnaevs exploded. Several of her friends were waiting at the finish line. They were unharmed. \"It was just an overwhelming feeling of shock to start hearing about it and seeing images,\" DiVasta said. \"You couldn't help but cry and just ask why.\" What's next for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev?

Truckers from Bulgaria, Poland and Romania, who already work in the UK, are being offered \u00a3100 for each driver they manage to lure into Britain from their home country. Employment agency Mainline is offering the incentive to any worker who refers a qualified Class A HGV driver to undertake work for four weeks. Truckers from Bulgaria, Poland and Romania who already work in the UK are being offered \u00a3100 by employment agency Mainline (pictured)\u00a0to lure drivers from their home country to work in Britain . The company did try a recruitment drive to attract lorry drivers from Cornwall to their base in Swindon. But they say they were forced to look further afield when that scheme failed. This is despite there being 3,000 jobless residents in Swindon. Around 4.5 per cent are also unemployed across the south west. The vacancy crisis will re-ignite claims that Britain\u2019s generous welfare system has created a generation unwilling to work, while acting as a magnet for foreigners. Debbie Jameson, from Mainline, said those who arrive from Eastern Europe are willing to work 'as many hours as they can' - something which she said British workers are less keen to do. She said: 'We don't just recruit drivers, we also recruit for permanent roles, call centre roles, industrial roles - everything. 'But it's mainly the skilled workers which we've been struggling to recruit. Numbers of HGV drivers have been dwindling over the years for various reasons.' Ms Jameson said one of the deterrents is the \u00a32,000 outlay that is needed to get a lorry-driving licence. She said many still struggle to get jobs after that, because they are newly qualified drivers and do not have any experience. Mainline said it will offer to help workers from overseas find accommodation and settle into a new life in the UK. It will also provide them with courses so they have the chance to familiarise themselves with British roads, customs and culture. The company did try a recruitment drive to get lorry drivers to relocate from Cornwall to their base in Swindon. But they were forced to look further abroad when that scheme failed (file picture) She said: 'As numbers dwindled, we needed to use a bit of ingenuity. So we asked our workers to help us do our jobs by using their contacts in these countries to help fill these positions. 'We also offer it throughout the UK, and it used to be we'd have drivers from Scotland and Cornwall and Wales come to work in Swindon. We'd find them accommodation and help them settle in, but even that has dried up. 'In places like Romania, Bulgaria and Poland, the standard of living is far lower and wages are lower, and they can come over here to work. 'Even though the cost of living is quite high, the people who come to work are men, and they are here to make as much money as possible to support their families. 'It also means they are quite flexible and want to work as many hours as they can, which is something many people here don't want to do.' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith previously claimed that the last Labour Government\u2019s \u2018open-door\u2019 policy led to a huge influx of low-skilled migrant workers while its welfare system disincentivised Britons to work. Many employers have expressed concerns that they cannot get Britons to do manual jobs because they feel it is not the kind of work they want. Oppositely, in Eastern European countries, the average wage is around \u00a37,000 - meaning workers can earn almost double that in the UK, even on a minimum wage. They would also have their wages topped up with tax credits - seen as a major attraction for EU migrants - and housing benefit. In November last year, the UK\u2019s biggest sandwich maker said it was recruiting hundreds of workers from Eastern Europe for the same reason. Bosses from Greencore Group, which supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Asda, flew to Hungary today in search of staff for its new factory. Allyson Russell, Greencore\u2019s human resources director, said the company had tried to recruit in the UK, but that it was \u2018not always the kind of work\u2019 which people wanted to do.

As the election campaign slowed to mark the Easter weekend, the Prime Minister hailed the work of the Church and condemned the persecution of Christians following the massacre in  Kenya. Mr Cameron's praise for the Church comes after he criticised bishops  for a controversial election letter calling for a 'fresh moral vision of the kind of country we want to be' which was widely seen as an attack on the Coalition's welfare cuts. Scroll down for video . David Cameron feeds orphaned lambs on Dean Lane farm near the village of Chadlington in the Cotswolds . Mr Cameron took a break from the campaign trail to visit the orphaned lambs in the nearby farm in his constituency . Mr Cameron was taken t visit the lambs with farmer Julian Tustian at Dean Lane farm just outside the village of Chadlington . The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, has condemned certain welfare reforms as part of  a series of interventions by church leaders raising concerns about the shape of the economy. In his video message the Prime Minister, who has defended the right of the Church to intervene in political debate, said Easter was ' time to reflect on the part that Christianity plays in our national life'. 'The Church is not just a collection of beautiful old buildings;  it is a living, active force doing great works across our country,' he said. 'When people are homeless, the Church is there with hot meals and shelter.  When people are addicted or in debt; when people are suffering, or grieving - the Church is there.' 'Across Britain, Christians don't just talk about 'loving thy neighbour', they live it out ...  in faith schools, in prisons, in community groups. 'And it's for all these reasons that we should feel proud to say: this is a Christian country. 'Yes, we are a nation that embraces, welcomes and accepts all faiths and none  but we are still a Christian country.' Prime Minister David Cameron said Easter was 'time to reflect on the part that Christianity plays' in the UK . The PM, whose severely disabled son Ivan died in 2009, said that he knew ' from the most difficult times in my own life, that the kindness of the church can be a huge comfort'. The slaughter at Garissa University College in Kenya, where al Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab gunmen specifically sought out and killed Christian students, has been condemned by the Pope and other leaders as they mark Easter. 'We have a duty to speak out about the persecution of Christians around the world too,' Mr Cameron said. 'It is truly shocking to know that in 2015, there are still Christians being threatened, tortured - even killed - because of their faith... 'I n the coming months, we must continue to speak as one voice for freedom of belief. 'So this Easter, we should keep in our thoughts all those Christians facing persecution abroad  and give thanks for all those Christians who are making a real difference here at home.' Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said: ' While politicians in the UK are busy on the campaign trail, we must not forget the cruel and barbaric killings that took place in Kenya. 'The thoughts of people here are very much with the families and friends of the murdered students in Garissa University.' Mr Cameron and his wife  attended an Easter Sunday service at St Nicholas church in  Chadlington, near Chipping Norton . The Prime Minister has hailed the Church as a 'living active force doing great works' for the poor and homeless . Labour leader Ed Miliband said 'fear and uncertainty' were issues for Christians both in the UK and abroad. 'In the midst of the Easter celebrations our hearts go out to those who face difficult times both overseas and closer to home. My thoughts are particularly with Christians in Syria, Iraq and other countries where the church suffers terrible persecution,' he wrote in a post on Facebook. 'According to the International Society for Human Rights, Christians are the victims of 80% of all acts of religious discrimination in the world today. We must all do everything we can to speak out against this evil and work to alleviate the suffering of those who are persecuted simply for their creed. 'But we don't need to travel far to find families facing fear and uncertainty. Over two million children are now living in poverty in the UK. I have admiration for those church members and Christian charities that provide support and hope to those in need. 'Over the Easter weekend millions of Christians will attend Easter services and events up and down the country. Through such gatherings, the Church shares the story of the resurrection, and spreads the good news of Easter. 'In the months to come I hope that we will all stand up for justice, serve the most vulnerable and work to positively transform our communities together.'", "reference": "Prime Minister hailed charity work of the Church across the country .\nHe also condemned persecution of Christians following massacre in Kenya .\nMr Cameron's praise for the Church comes after bishops attacked Coaltion .", "pred_summary": "David Cameron has called on people to 'feel proud to say this is a Christian country' in his annual Easter message."}

Michael Rapiejko was accused of approaching a man as he got out of his car in October 2005 and pointing a gun at him before handcuffing him and threatening to shoot him in front of his wife and four children. The plaintiff, Luis Colon, also claimed that Rapiejko choked him and ordered that he get back into his car. Scroll down for videos . Michael Rapiejko (above) was accused of approaching Luis Colon as he got out of his car in October 2005, pointing a gun at him and threatening to shoot him . According to NBC 4, Rapiejko's defense team said that while their client did point a gun at the man and order him back into his car, the other claims were untrue. Colon was charged with obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, all charges that were dropped in April 2006. In the end, the city settled with Colon for $20,000 under the condition that he dismiss all other claims. The settlement was reached in December 2008, the same time Rapiejko left the New York Police Department and joined the Tucson Police Department. This as Rapiejko is under fire for using possible excessive force when he mowed down an armed suspect (above) in his police vehicle . The officer joined the Marana Police Department roughly a year-and-a-half ago, where he is now being investigated by Internal Affairs. Rapiejko, a Cross Fit devotee, calls himself Robocop. Video of the February 19 incident emerged earlier this week, and shows Rapiejko, 34, running into suspect Mario Valencia, who was carrying what appears to be a rifle, and who seems to point the weapon to the sky and fire off shots. A police officer in one of the patrol cars says: 'One round just went out. He's definitely loaded.' He then tells his colleague, Officer Michael Rapiejko, in the other vehicle: 'Stand off, the gun is loaded.' Mario Valencia (above) was in the hospital for two days after being hit by Rapiejko . But apparently ignoring his advice, Rapiejko overtakes the officer's car, before speeding straight toward Valencia. Seconds later, his vehicle mounts the curb and smashes into the suspect's body. Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall before coming to a halt amid debris. The other officer can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down.' Valencia was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in serious condition following the crash and was eventually booked into jail two days later. Sergeant Chris Warren said at the time that Valencia 'was a dangerous felon who'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning'. This crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at, vandalism and burglary at the Tucson Baptist Temple, a home invasion and theft of a car. It culminated with the alleged theft of a rifle from Walmart, after which he was hit by Rapiejko's police vehicle. Rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash, but soon reinstated after\u00a0the Pima County Attorney's Office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing.

{"article": "Just days after the former Australian swimming champion's unexpected comeback, Grant Hackett's father has revealed that the sleeping pill addiction which ruined his son's personal life and tarnished his career, was triggered by a death threat. Former police inspector Neville Hackett said that his son had 'his life threatened by a well-known associate of criminals' two years ago, leading the swimmer to immediately hop on a plane to his parent's home in the Gold Coast. 'I know he used Stilnox while he was swimming but he wasn't hooked on it. It was when his life was threatened and he couldn't sleep at night from all the worry,' Hackett senior told The Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Grant Hackett's father has revealed the swimmer's sleeping pill addiction was triggered by a death threat . The revelation comes after the 34-year-old made a come back last Sunday when he earned a 2015 world titles relay team berth by cruising to fourth place in one minute and 46.84 seconds . 'That's what really caused the Stilnox abuse and the addiction.' Hackett senior admitted that while the threat was never reported to police, it was taken very seriously by the swimmer's family. The dual Olympic champion appears to have recovered from his tumultuous year, which ended with  a five-week stint in an Arizona rehab clinic. Following his swimming comeback on Sunday night, in which he earned a 2015 world titles relay team berth by cruising to fourth place in one minute and 46.84 seconds, Hackett reflected on how much he had turned his life around in the past 12 months. Former police inspector Neville Hackett (centre) said that his son had 'his life threatened by a well-known associate of criminals' two years ago . The addiction to Stilnox which ensued, led Hackett's personal life to fall apart last year. It also began around the time he divorced Australian singer Candice Alley in August 2013 . 'If you had asked me 10 years ago if the only thing that got me on the team was on the relay it would be bitter disappointment,' Hackett said. 'But right now, it is one of the biggest achievements of my life.' The 34-year-old made the team after only six months of training following a six-year layoff, with his training schedule involving 55-60km of swimming a week and three gym sessions, according to coach Denis Cotterell. While Hackett's personal life fell apart last year due to his sleeping pill addiction, his professional demons went back as far as his last major meet, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, where he was denied a record third straight 1500m gold medal. The dual Olympic champion said, following his Sunday night achievement: 'If you had asked me 10 years ago if the only thing that got me on the team was on the relay it would be bitter disappointment, but right now, it is one of the biggest achievements of my life' He made the team after only six months of training following a six-year layoff, with his training schedule now involving 55-60km of swimming a week and three gym sessions, according to coach Denis Cotterell (pictured) 'I will be honest. I hated the sport for a long time,' Hackett said. 'I got scared getting into a bathtub. 'To discover a love for something that has been such a big part of my life is really pleasing now because I don't walk away with that taste of Olympic silver in my mouth by a few hundredths of a second. 'I can really enjoy the sport for what it is now.' Hackett had been adamant he had not even launched a comeback after entering the 2015 national titles. 'It was a challenging few years and I had to live it pretty publicly,' Hackett said . But, he allowed himself a moment to reflect on how far he had come in the past year while savouring the remarkable 200m result in which he shaved three seconds off his best time since his return. 'It was a challenging few years and I had to live it pretty publicly,' Hackett said. 'One thing I am good at is listening to people around me.

Right to be a woman: \u00a0U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco ruled that denying sex reassignment surgery to  Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, 51, \u00a0pictured last year, violates her constitutional rights . Her birth name is Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy. Norsworthy has been in prison since 1987, serving a life sentence for second-degree murder. She has twice delayed her scheduled parole hearings in recent months. The ruling says it would be the second time nationwide that such a surgery has been performed on an inmate, an apparent reference to an inmate who castrated himself in Texas then was given the surgery out of necessity. Norsworthy has lived as a woman since the 1990s and has what Tigar termed severe gender dysphoria. 'The weight of the evidence demonstrates that for Norsworthy, the only adequate medical treatment for her gender dysphoria is SRS,' Tigar wrote, referring to sex reassignment surgery. He found that the decision by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to deny the procedure was medically unacceptable under the circumstances. Corrections officials said they are considering whether to appeal the ruling. Attorneys for Norsworthy did immediately comment. Paid surgery: Michelle-Lael Norsworthy has been living as a woman since the 1990s and her birth name is Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy. 'This would be a first for California, said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver who controls California prison medical care. The cost to taxpayers for such surgery is uncertain, she said. 'It's several tens of thousands of dollars, possibly close to $100,000, depending on the circumstances. But It's hard to estimate,' Hayhoe said. Corrections officials, in previous court filings, argued that Norsworthy has received proper medical and mental health care for more than 15 years and is in no immediate medical danger if the surgery is not performed. Her care has included counseling, mental health treatment and hormone therapy that the department said 'has changed her physical appearance and voice to that of a woman' while helping her find her gender identity. That care is consistent with what other judges nationwide have found to be appropriate for transgender inmates, the department said. She currently is housed at Mule Creek State Prison, an all-male prison in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento. The sex change surgery will prompt practical problems, the department said. The department also said keeping Norsworthy in a men's prison could invite violence, including possible assault and rape. But she could also face danger at a women's prison \u2014 or pose a threat herself \u2014 because she had a history of domestic violence before her murder conviction, the department said.

{"article": "Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists he is not concerned that Romelu Lukaku has joined forces with high-powered agent Mino Raiola ahead of a potential summer of transfer speculation surrounding the striker. Raiola, steeped in Italian and Dutch football, is one of the most influential agents in the game, with Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba and Liverpool\u2019s Mario Balotelli among his high-profile clients. The Italian middleman has been involved in transfer deals worth over \u00a3400million and Lukaku\u2019s decision to sever his links with Christophe Henrotay, who oversaw his Everton club record \u00a328m move from Chelsea last summer, adds a possible new dimension to his career. Romelu Lukaku (left) poses alongside his new agent Mino Raiola in an Instagram picture . The appointment of Raiola as agent fuels speculation Lukaku (left) could be set for a move away from Everton . Roberto Martinez, the Everton manager, is unconcerned by Lukaku joining Raiola . The Belgium striker, 21, has scored only eight times in the Premier League so far this season compared with 15 last term. But he has netted 18 in total, including eight in the Europa League which spearheaded Everton\u2019s run to the last 16. With Everton 13th in the Barclays Premier League there will be no European adventure next season but Martinez, who persuaded Lukaku to turn a season-long loan into a permanent five-year deal last summer, is adamant that the player\u2019s switch of agents has not set the alarm bells ringing. Martinez said: \u2018He has changed his agent, yes, but we are not concerned, no. Rom is entitled to do that. \u2018Everyone speaks about the colourful character that Mino Raiola is but he has a lot of players who are very much people who are happy to stay at one club. \u2018I dealt with Mino Raiola at Wigan and not many people know that he had Danny de Ridder or Vladimir Weiss, players who have been happy to stay at a club. I don\u2019t think there is anything to read into that.\u2019 Martinez does not expect a summer of upheaval at Goodison Park, despite the team\u2019s disappointing campaign. Veteran defender Sylvain Distin, 37, who has not featured in the league since late December, will leave at the end of his contract but, according to Martinez, fellow centre back Antolin Alcaraz still has a chance to earn a new deal during the closing weeks of the season. Meanwhile, the manager insists 21-year-old midfielder Ross Barkley can build on his performances from the bench for England against Lithuania and Italy to finish an indifferent season on a high. \u2018He will benefit from the experiences of this difficult season,\u2019 added Martinez, whose side entertain Southampton on Saturday.

{"article": "Britain's aid budget may have to soar by hundreds of millions of pounds a year because of new EU rules, it has emerged. Despite the fact that the UK has now met the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid, changes to Brussels accounting rules could bump up the bill even more. Official figures released this week reveal that Britain met the target last year, spending \u00a311.7billion on foreign aid projects. The UK is now the second largest aid donor in the world. Spending on foreign aid is set to increase by an extra \u00a31billion over the next two years because of new EU rules . But new EU accounting rules \u2013 to which Britain has signed up \u2013 are being brought in which change the way national income is measured. The new total includes estimates of parts of the black economy such as prostitution and drug running. It means that Gross National Income will rise \u2013 pushing up the amount that will need to be spent on aid to meet the 0.7 per cent target. One aid expert said it could mean an increase of \u00a3500million in the aid budget in 2016 and 2017. The news that Britain\u2019s overseas contributions will swell even further was unpopular with Tory backbenchers, many of whom believe it was wrong to spend so much when the defence budget faces cuts. Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Tory defence minister, said: \u2018What is the point of this arbitrary figure of spending 0.7 per cent of GDP? \u2018The idea that if we spend this amount all the world\u2019s problems will end is absurd, or that by providing that magic figure we suddenly become paragons of virtue. \u2018If a change in the formula means the British taxpayer has to contribute yet more in overseas aid ... a lot of people will start questioning the largesse of this country. There are many military figures who just don\u2019t see the logic of putting money into aid instead of defence.\u2019 The new accounting rules are being phased in and the Department for International Development said they would only apply from 2016. Britain met the 0.7 per cent aid target thanks to a frantic effort that meant increasing the budget by 30 per cent in one year. A highly critical Commons report found that ministers had splurged large amounts in the final months \u2013 with few checks \u2013 just so they could say they had met the target. And last November an independent report slammed DfID for a failure to tackle corruption in developing countries. Late last year, the change to EU accountancy rules landed Britain with a huge \u00a31.7billion increase in contributions to Brussels. Nigel Farage (left) has called for the foreign aid budget to be cut by up to \u00a310billion . Millions of pounds of British aid money could be sent to war-torn Eritrea \u2013 despite warnings it will be misused by the brutal regime. Diplomatic sources say the European Commission is drawing up plans for a potential \u00a3240million aid package to help stem the tide of asylum seekers heading for the EU. The move would mean a six-fold increase in the level of EU aid to the African state, with Britain\u2019s share amounting to around \u00a331million. Campaigners say Eritrea has one of the worst human rights records in the world, with thousands of political activists locked up and tortured and citizens forced to do military service into their seventies. The move will also raise concerns about the lack of accountability attached to the \u00a31.1billion Britain hands to the EU to disperse each year. More than 20 campaign groups and academics have signed an open letter calling for a halt to the aid package until Eritrea agrees to comply with a UN inquiry. They say the EU may be acting illegally by handing money to the country, which has been ruled by dictator Isaias Afewerki since 1993.", "reference": "UK spent \u00a311.7billion on overseas aid last year but that is set to increase .\nNew accounting rules could see budget increase by \u00a31bn over two years .\nChanges will bring Britain in line with other EU nations who donate less .\nUkip leader Nigel Farage last night called for a \u00a310billion cut in foreign aid .", "pred_summary": "EU accounting rules change the way national income is measured.\nIt means that Gross National Income will rise - pushing up the amount that will need to be spent on aid to meet the 0.7% target."}

{"article": "A woman has been jailed for using her stiletto heel to inflict permanent injuries on a stranger during an unprovoked attack in a nightclub toilet. Shannon Carter, 21, repeatedly struck 20-year-old Amelia Gledhill with the shoe after a row broke out between their friends on a night out in Bradford. Ms Gledhill is said to have been left traumatised by the incident and is still having problems with her eyesight. Shannon Carter, 21 (pictured) has been jailed for three-and-a-half years for attacking Amelia Gledhill, 20, (pictured right) with a stiletto during a night out. Ms Gledhill still has a scar above her right eye . She has also been left with permanent scarring and is afraid to leave the house alone. During the case at Bradford Crown Court, the court was told how there had been a confrontation between one of Carter's friends and a friend of victim in a bar in Bradford city centre earlier in the evening. The court heard how Miss Gledhill and her friend then saw Carter in  NV night club. Despite Miss Gledhill having nothing to do with the argument, Carter then followed the victim into the toilets, where she carried out the 'unprovoked' attack. As well as sustaining an injury just above her right eye, Ms Gledhill also suffered a deep wound to her arm, the court heard. The victim was given stitches at Bradford Royal infirmary. She also had to return to the hospital on a number of occasions for further treatment, the court heard. She was also left with bruises, a permanent scar and with blurred vision in her right eye. The attack took place in NV nightclub (pictured) during a night out in Bradford City Centre. There had been an earlier confrontation between one of Carter's friends and a friend of the victim . The court heard she also had to take time off work and became too afraid to go out, without being accompanied by her boyfriend. Carter, from East Bowling, Bradford, pleaded guilty to wounding with intent. For the defence, Simon Hustler said Carter had nursed her grandmother, looked after her grandfather and was also a carer for her mother. He added that the attack was an isolated incident and that she had committed no further offences. He also told the court that there was evidence of a mental disorder. Sentencing her to three-and-a-half years in jail, Judge David Hatton QC said Carter had caused the victim permanent scarring and other psychological consequences. The judge said: 'This is a tragic case, revealing the frequent danger and consequence of excessive drinking; tragic, not least because I am satisfied that it was out of character.' But he added that it was a serious offence which could only be dealt with by an immediate custodial sentence. Judge Hatton said: 'I judge your risk of reoffending not to be high. I take account of the fact that any sentence of imprisonment will be in itself a considerable punishment.' He added: 'I derive no pleasure whatever from imposing a sentence of imprisonment on a young woman in your position but I would be failing in my public duty if I did not do so.' After the case, Detective Constable Glen Doran, of Bradford District CID, said: 'This was a particularly nasty and unprovoked assault which left the victim with permanent injuries. 'Such incidents will not be tolerated in Bradford District, and I hope the sentence handed down today will serve as a warning to others.'", "reference": "Shannon Carter, 21, repeatedly hit Amelia Gledhill, 20, in a Bradford club .\nMs Gledhill\u00a0left with blurred vision, wounds, bruises and scars, court heard .\nCarter jailed for three-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to wounding .", "pred_summary": "Shannon Carter repeatedly struck 20-year-old Amelia Gledhill with the shoe after a row broke out between their friends.\nVictim suffered a deep wound to her arm and a permanent scar above her right eye.\nJudge sentences Carter to three-and-a-half-years in jail."}

{"article": "(CNN)The complete skeleton of a camel thought to to have been used by Ottoman troops besieging Vienna in the 17th century has been found beneath a cellar in Austria. The remains were uncovered by archaeologists from the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna (Vetmeduni), exploring the construction site for a shopping center in the city of Tulln in 2006-2007. \"The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,\" archaeozoologist Alfred Galik said. \"But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel.\" In their research, published in the journal \"PLOS ONE,\" the archaeologists said Ottoman troops had besieged the area around Tulln in 1683 as they tried to reach Vienna, but that Tulln itself had never been conquered. The Ottoman Army had a \"camelry,\" using camels for transportation and to ride, they said. Despite their city not falling, Tulln inhabitants and the Ottomans were in contact, with historic documents referring to the invading army's peaceful surrender of two prisoners of war, the researchers said. But they said it would be impossible to say how it got into the city. \"Its appearance might be linked to an exchange of local people with the troops or the Ottoman army simply left it behind. Apparently, the citizens took it inside the town, where they probably kept and displayed it as an 'exotic animal,'\" they said. \"It seems quite conceivable that being not familiar with behavioral and feeding habits, the scarcity of food in wartimes, people did not keep it for long.\" While other camel bones have been found in Central Europe, the researchers said this was unique. \"It is the first complete camel skeleton found in Central Europe and Central European territories under the control of the Ottoman Empire, apart from the complete skeleton of a dromedary recovered from the sediments of the Theodosius harbor on the European part of Istanbul.\" DNA analysis on the Tulln skeleton confirmed that it had been one of a hybrid species of camel, specifically a \"Tulu,\" the offspring of dromedary female and a male with Bactrian DNA. \"The two species are able to interbreed, which results in larger, more powerful and efficient hybrid offspring,\" researchers said. \"The camel specimen from Tulln is the first archaeozoologically and genetically confirmed evidence of a Tulu hybrid camel.\" The camel was also believed to have been castrated to make it easier to handle. The Austrians' unfamiliarity with such a beast may have led to the skeleton's preservation. As opposed to the Ottoman troops -- who would likely have eaten the camel's flesh -- the residents of Tulln apparently buried the camel whole. \"The dismemberment of the carcasses certainly is a reason for the scarce preservation of camel finds in general and is indicated by bones with butchering marks in particular. However, the citizens buried this camel in a typical post-mortal position, and together with rubbish in the remnants of a cellar that was leveled,\" researchers said. In their report, the researchers said the camel was found on the site of what had been an old tavern called \"Auf der Rossmuhle.\" \"The backfill of the cellar yielded masses of domestic refuse like animal bones and ceramics (e.g. plates, pans and flagons), pieces of a tiled stove and enameled pipe bowls which date the filling in the early modern period,\" they said. A coin dating from 1643-1715 and a medicine bottle from a chemist's operating from 1628-1665 helped the team date the site. Flooding and plagues affected Tulln in the 17th century and many buildings were demolished, they said. \"Two building plots got new owners at the end of the century around the 1690, certainly the time when the cellar was backfilled, offering enough space to bury such a big cadaver in the center of the town,\" their report explains. \"The skeleton remained there for more than 300 years to raise questions in the future.\"", "reference": "Archaeologists have found the skeleton of a camel below a cellar in an Austrian village .\nThey believe the camel was from the 17th century  Osmanic-Habsburg war .\nOttoman troops used camels as troops during the conflict .", "pred_summary": "Archaeologists found the skeleton of a camel in a cellar in the Austrian city of Tulln.\nIt is the first complete camel skeleton found in Central Europe and Central European territories under Ottoman Empire.\nThe camel was believed to have been castrated to make it easier to handle."}

He added: \u2018A couple of them were walking a bit too well in their high heels.

In the video, the men mimic the advert, walking towards the camera in a line of five, with groom Gareth in the middle,  pulling a variety of humorous\u00a0poses from the TV commercial. Later in the video the stag do can be seen garnering much attention from locals, holiday goers and even the police. Mr Rowles said: \u2018The whole promenade was at a standstill. People were cheering and clapping and all different nationalities stood around to watch and take photos. \u2018A police car went past and I was trying to get them to beep their sirens.

Over 5000 people die from asbestos-related diseases each year, making it a bigger killer than road accidents . Over 50 families, all grieving for a loved one lost to asbestos exposure, have contributed heartfelt messages to a new moving artwork to help raise awareness, unveiled this week in Covent Garden, London . Currently on display in Covent Garden, London, the installation is made up of heartfelt messages from people who have lost loved ones to asbestos-related diseases. Many are widows whose husbands were exposed during trade work, children who have lost fathers, and others mourning wives, mothers and grandparents. Over 50 families have contributed to the art project, with personal messages to their departed. Created as part of HSE\u2019s Beware Asbestos campaign, the artwork is made up of two huge glass boxes, inside which the messages float around representing a breathing pair of lungs. Award-winning artist Joe Joiner, from East London, has created the art installation as part of\u00a0HSE\u2019s Beware Asbestos campaign. Joe, whose great-grandmother died after being exposed to asbestos while working at a factory, revealed he initially thought it was a last-century phenomenon. However, while talking about his project with friends and family, more and more cases made themselves known . The messages, written on pieces of paper, are symbolic of the microscopic asbestos fibres inhaled by those exposed. Causing deadly diseases including mesothelioma, an aggressive form of lung cancer, asbestos can be a deadly killer to those unaware of its presence. Among the contributors is Lauren Ross, 56, from Didsbury, Manchester, who lost her husband Frank in 2007. Lauren Ross, 56, from Didsbury, Manchester, lost her husband Frank, a shop fitter and joiner, in 2007 to\u00a0mesothelioma, an aggressive form of lung cancer caused by exposure to microscopic asbestos fibres . Mrs Ross joined other widows and families who have lost loved ones to asbestos-related diseases at the unveiling of the art installation in Covent Garden, London. She has vowed to continue raising awareness . A \u00a0shop fitter and joiner for most of his life, Frank died of\u00a0mesothelioma aged 60, just a year after he was diagnosed with the condition. 'He first felt a pain in his side on holiday at the end of August 2005 and was treated at first for a pulled muscle,' recalls Mrs Ross. 'In January, he was sent for a chest X-ray due to the pain and some shortage of breath. Poignant: The messages in the installation are symbolic of the microscopic asbestos fibres inhaled by those exposed . 'He was told on 13 January what they thought he had and had further tests from there. He died a year later in February. 'What really upset Frank was the fact that he must have been bringing asbestos into our house for years, potentially affecting me and our four children,' she added. 'This was something he had absolutely no idea about.' Created as part of HSE\u2019s Beware Asbestos campaign, the artwork is made up of two huge glass boxes, inside which the messages float around representing a breathing pair of lungs . Despite experiencing a great deal of pain, Frank continued to raise awareness about the risks of asbestos, and necessary measures to protect workers. 'Since his death I am determined to continue his work in raising awareness, and also to make it clear to tradespeople that - unless you follow all the necessary safety procedures - there is a chance you are taking asbestos home to the ones you love,' says Mrs Ross. 'I want people to be aware that deaths from exposure to asbestos are not a historic issue, but something that can happen to anyone today if the appropriate measures aren\u2019t taken.'

Hardaker was at the centre of a police assault probe into an attack on a 22-year-old man at student flats in Leeds, but was not charged with any offence. Leeds issued a lengthy statement outlining Hardaker's punishment, which will also see him forfeit one month's salary to be donated to a local charity and do up to 20 hours a week of voluntary work for the club's foundation for the duration of his contract. Hardaker and team-mate Elliot Minchella both paid \u00a3200 in compensation and wrote a letter of apology to a 22-year-old man following a police investigation but Leeds said Hardaker's punishment is far stronger 'given his previous misconduct'. Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker (centre with the ball) on an anger management course . The one-cap England international received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year and was also fined by England for breaching team discipline during the 2013 World Cup. The statement from Leeds read: 'The club has accepted his apology for his actions, however, given his previous misconduct, Zak has realised that it is his actions rather than his words that must now show his intentions to put these events behind him.' It went on: 'We have passed the point of telling him what he has to do, however, for the first time Zak has admitted to us and, more importantly to himself, that he has an issue with aspects of his lifestyle which he wants to improve. 'We have listened to what he has committed to do for himself and we will support him.' Minchella received a written warning and a fine of 50 per cent of his monthly salary, while team-mates Rob Mulhern, Josh Walters and Ash Handley were fined and issued verbal warnings. Police said the student received two black eyes and a bruised neck during the incident. Hardaker received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year . Leeds Rhinos have today issued the following statement relating to an incident which happened in the city earlier this year that was brought into the public spotlight: . 'The Leeds Rhinos Players Code of Conduct prohibits players from visiting licensed premises after midnight without prior permission from me or the Head Coach. Our investigation has revealed this regulation was breached by five players on a midweek evening before the start of this season. Furthermore Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella were involved in an incident at a student accommodation building, which led to a police investigation and a written apology from both players to a student and a \u00a3200 compensation payment from Hardaker and Minchella. 'Our internal investigation has now concluded. It has been an exhaustive process and we are always disappointed when players fall below the standards we expect of them and let everyone else down. The players themselves are embarrassed and very apologetic and I am sure it has been a lesson learned for all involved. 'Rob Mulhern, Josh Walters and Ash Handley have each received a fine and a verbal warning. Elliot Minchella has received a written warning and a fine of 50% of his monthly salary. 'With regard to Zak Hardaker, the club has accepted his apology for his actions, however, given his previous misconduct, Zak has realized that it is his actions rather than his words that must now show his intentions to put these events behind him. Therefore, we have agreed the following actions: . 1) Zak will forfeit one months salary and this will be donated to support a local charity project . 2) He will enroll on a course for anger management . 3) Zak will work as a volunteer for up to 20 hours a week for the duration of his Rhinos contract to assist the Leeds Rhinos Foundation and Marketing Department. 'Zak is full of passion and enthusiasm and has many qualities that are to be admired in a young player but a small part of him has led to problems and this has to be addressed, not only for the image of the game but most importantly for Zak\u2019s own well being and his ability to fulfil his potential. We have passed the point of telling him what he has to do, however, for the first time Zak has admitted to us and, more importantly to himself, that he has an issue with aspects of his lifestyle which he wants to improve. We have listened to what he has committed to do for himself and we will support him.'", "reference": "Leeds Rhinos issued statement outlining Zak Hardaker's punishment .\nHardaker has been sent on an anger management course by the club .\nStudent suffered two black eyes and bruised neck in incident at flats .\nNo-one has been charged, but other Leeds players have been disciplined .", "pred_summary": "Zak Hardaker will enroll on an anger management course after a violent incident in February.\nThe England international was at the centre of a police assault probe into an attack on a student at student flats in Leeds.\nHe will also forfeit one month's salary to be donated to a local charity and do up to 20 hours a week of voluntary work for the club's foundation."}

Opening in 2018, the gigantic Terminal 1 will cover 700,000 square metres, and is set to handle 45million passengers a year. Renown British-Iraqi architect, Zaha Hadid, has collaborated with airport developers ADPI to create a six-tier concept which aims to decrease customer walking distances, and increase connectivity. Scroll down for video . Terminal 1 at\u00a0Beijing International Airport is set to the largest in the world, in order to cope with the surge in tourist numbers . Aiming to be the perfect welcome to Beijing, the designs focus on creating a feeling of space and openness, which is reflected in the flowing lines of the roof, and the lack of pillars inside. All the passenger pathways will convene in a central multi-layered courtyard, which will be a meeting place for passengers who have travelled from around the globe. Zaha Hadid's website states that the structure of Terminal 1 will guide users seamlessly and harmoniously through the building by public spaces that flow into each other, reflecting the harmony and balance between Chinese landscape and culture. It is hoped to combine the rich Chinese culture, with its impressive future on the worldwide stage. The huge terminal will focus on wide open spaces, made possible by the lack of pillars and flowing roof design . The international airport, which also goes by the name of Daxing Airport, is the second busiest in the world, after Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport which saw 96 million passengers pass through it last year. London Heathrow was the third busiest in the world with over 73 million passengers.

{"article": "(CNN)In case you needed a reminder that President Barack Obama isn't running for office again, he just alienated not only Republicans, who have largely resented him from day one, but the progressive base of Democratic voters. Obama has argued with the progressive potentate Elizabeth Warren, calling her \"wrong\" on trade policy.  The Massachusetts senator is the same potentate to whom Hillary Clinton has been religiously prostrating.  What everyone does next will be critical for the 2016 elections and the future of Democratic politics. Warren has publicly criticized so-called \"fast track\" trade authority that would allow the White House to negotiate massive, multination trade deals with little congressional oversight.  The authority would pave the way for trade pacts such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is modeled on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and has killed 700,000 American jobs and drove wages down in the United States while simultaneously decimating Mexican agriculture and small businesses. Aspects of the TPP deal would provide incentives for off-shoring jobs to low-wage countries, imposing limits on government regulations around food safety and the environment, and create mechanisms for multinational corporations to challenge any domestic laws they simply don't like. In December, Warren wrote a letter signed by several other Democrats to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman raising concerns about the TPP.  The letter warned that the TPP could erode safeguards that have been put in place to \"prevent future financial crises.\" \"We cannot afford a trade deal that undermines the government's ability to protect the American economy,\" Warren wrote. At a town hall with MSNBC's Chris Matthews on Tuesday, President Obama said, \"I love Elizabeth. We're allies on a whole host of issues. But she's wrong on this.\" Obama added, \"When you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts, they are wrong.\" But \"I'm right and she's wrong\" doesn't exactly come off as a thoughtful, let alone respectful, response to the policy critiques of one of the most trusted economic justice leaders in the Democratic Party today. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is trying to walk a fine line somewhere in the middle.  Clinton has recently courted Warren's support while forcefully repeating the rhetoric of populism. But according to a report by The New York Times, Clinton's staff is at pains to suggest that Clinton has always been a populist as opposed to merely trying to now co-opt a current trend.  Yet it becomes harder to paint Clinton as the \"original Elizabeth Warren\" each time she equivocates on trade policy and the TPP. In a 2012 speech as secretary of state, Clinton praised the TPP as \"the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" But now, as she campaigns for president facing a Democratic electorate divided over the deal, Clinton is sounding more critical. \"Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,\" Clinton said this week. So does Clinton support the TPP deal or not? Campaigning in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Clinton reportedly declined to say one way or the other.  That's not the behavior of a fierce populist.  It's more indicative of the sort of politically calculated, ideologically centrist \"triangulation\" for which her husband was famous. Seizing on Clinton's ambiguity, her potential challenger in the Democratic primary, Martin O'Malley, released a video this week making clear that he is against the TPP. According to a poll, as of 2012 just 1 in 4 Americans believed that NAFTA had benefited U.S. workers and only 1 in 3 believed it had benefited the U.S. economy overall. Even most Republicans in this poll supported the position that the United States should either \"renegotiate\" or \"leave\" NAFTA versus \"continue to be a member.\" In other words, any political leader with even the dimmest grasp of economics let alone political pragmatism should run away from a new trade deal modeled on imitating and expanding NAFTA.  While it's not surprising that Republicans are siding with big business and against working Americans in supporting the TPP, it's befuddling that President Obama supports it. The only hope now is for 2016 Democratic candidates, especially Clinton at this point, to support populism not just in rhetoric but in real policy terms and show which party is, for the most part, on the side of the people and not on the side of multinational corporations. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid minced no words in revealing his position about trade \"fast track\" authority: \"I'm not only no, I'm hell no.\" If Hillary Clinton wants to prove she's a real populist, now's her chance to be even more clear.", "reference": "Sen.

{"article": "The Secret Service took more than a year to replace a broken alarm system at the home of George H.W. Bush, it has emerged. The alarm failed at the former president's Houston residence in September 2013 and even though the Secret Service bought a replacement system in January 2014, it took until December  for it to be installed - leaving the couple without the protection of a working alarm at their home for 15 months. It came despite an agent's recommendation in 2010 that the alarm, which was installed in 1993, be replaced because it 'had exceeded its life cycle'. The request was denied for an unknown reason. The oversight - just the latest in a string of blunders by the agency - was revealed in a report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, which was released on Thursday. Concerns:\u00a0Former First Lady Barbara Bush and former President George H.W. Bush, pictured watching basketball in March, did not have a working alarm at their Houston home for more than a year . During the time the alarm was out of service, the Secret Service assigned an employee to keep watch over the residence, according to the report,CBS News\u00a0reported. Some inside the agency contended that the agent was not sufficient to replace the alarm system, the Washington Post reported. Despite the apparently relaxed security measures, there were no breaches at the property, where 90-year-old Bush and his wife Barbara have lived for more than two decades. On Twitter on Thursday, Bush said that he and his wife have 'great respect for, and confidence in, the men and women' of the Secret Service. 'That respect and confidence has never waned,' he wrote. Endorsement: In light of the reports, Bush tweeted that he had 'great respect' for the Secret Service . Property: Their Houston home, circle, was guarded by a Secret Service agent throughout the 15 months . The report also raises concerns about the security at other former presidents' homes, but has redacted their names. Among the concerns, one official reported that safety equipment showed 'signs of impending failure'. In January, the Washington Post reported that the alarm system at Vice President Joe Biden's home was failing so agents had simply switched the system off. They were told that budget constraints meant the repairs would have to wait. The new report, which was addressed to Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy, recommended that the agency reviews all security equipment and looks into how it keeps track of maintenance issues. 'With these fixes in place, we believe the Secret Service will more effectively meet its mission to protect the lives and homes of our former presidents,' Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth, who wrote the report, said in a statement. Blunders: A member of the Secret Service patrols outside the White House last September after a man managed to scale the fence, run across the lawn and enter the property without being stopped . Embarrassment: Last week, a man landed a gyrocopter on the U.S. Capitol lawn in the latest embarrassment for security teams in Washington D.C. Pictured, a member of a bomb squad checks out the aircraft . Clancy agreed with the recommendations and said that the Secret Service had launched a review before the investigations. The report's findings are just the latest embarrassment for the Secret Service, which has seen its reputation tarnished by a string of missteps in recent months. Last year, Iraq war veteran Omar Gonzalez scaled the fence of the White House and managed to enter the residence - running right past agents, who also failed to release a dog in time. Earlier this year, two agents drove through an active bomb investigation, and last week, a protester flying a gyrocopter managed to land on the lawn on the U.S. Capitol in D.C.", "reference": "The alarm system at the former president's Houston property failed around September 2013 but was not replaced until December 2014 .\nIt came after an agent recommended in 2010 that the 20-year system be replaced but the request was denied .\nThe details emerged in a report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General released on Thursday .\nThe report recommended that the agency reviews all security equipment .", "pred_summary": "Barbara Bush and George H.W.

{"article": "(CNN)Chile's Calbuco Volcano erupted again Thursday, marking the third time since last week, the National Service of Geology and Mining said. Gregorio Billikopf lives across Lake Llanquihue from the volcano has been photographing and videotaping the three eruptions and described Thursday's event as spectacular but not as severe as the two prior ones. \"There is still smoke on and off, but nothing so dramatic (as before),\" said Billikopf, a retired university adviser on agricultural issues. \"On a good day I can see about eight volcanoes. \"I understand that the rain that was announced for today would have been a disaster,\" he added. He lives in a rainy part of Chile, which he described as like a Garden of Eden. The explosion produced an extensive plume, but it was also described as smaller than the eruptions on April 22 and April 23, according to CNN Chile. Deputy Interior Minister Mahmud Aleuy said about 1,500 people were evacuated, and security measures will continue as \"contingency plans are operating,\" CNN Chile reported Thursday. For the past several days, the geology agency has maintained there was a possibility of a third eruption as part of steadily declining seismic activity in the area. A 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone has been established around the crater, and Chilean authorities have been keeping residents away from that zone. Last week, military and police forces helped evacuate more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said then. The seismic event is sure to add to the volume of ash already spewed since the first eruption. Ash spread to Argentina in the second eruption, which occurred a day after the first. Evacuations in the region involved not only people but also animals. The volcanic debris has landed and piled up in some places to a depth of almost 2 feet, the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety said. New advisories say airborne ash could reach an altitude of 12,000 feet. There was no immediate information on the strength of the third eruption, but government officials have said the second, spectacular nighttime eruption was stronger than the first one. Last week in Ensenada, houses, trees and even sheep were blanketed gray with ash. People were removing salmon -- a staple of the local economy -- because of fears of contamination from ash and lava. Trucks were used to evacuate farm animals and pets. Authorities last week issued a red alert for the popular tourist towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in southern Chile. Last week, people were being evacuated to Puerto Montt on 22 buses and military trucks, the Interior Ministry said. Officials said that volcanic flows from Calbuco caused rising water levels in the R\u00edo Blanco. The first eruption set off a bit of a panic in the region. \"At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew. And later, there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,\" a Puerto Montt resident said. Another person said: \"It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs.\" Magma expanse under Yellowstone supervolcano more vast than thought . The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was in 1962. There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996.

{"article": "(CNN)Nobel literature laureate Guenter Grass, best known around the world for his novel \"The Tin Drum,\" has died, his publisher said Monday. He was 87. Grass died in a clinic in the city of Luebeck, where he was taken over the weekend, said Steidl publishing spokeswoman Claudia Glenewinkel. German media are reporting he died of pneumonia. Grass focused in much of his work on learning from the horror of war and genocide by exploring motifs from his childhood city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk, Poland. During the Nazi era, ethnic Poles and Jews were persecuted and deported from the multicultural city, at a time when they faced the possibility of mass murder. \"In his excavation of the past, G\u00fcnter Grass goes deeper than most and he unearths the intertwined roots of good and evil,\" the Nobel committee wrote, when it awarded him the literature prize in 1999. But Grass, an outspoken public figure, has sparked controversy in the last decade. In 2006, he confessed that at the age of 15, in 1943, he volunteered for military service in Germany's war of aggression and ended up in the notoriously bloody Waffen SS. Grass said he had no excuses for his choices back then, and that, as a teen, he may even have been excited about belonging to the unit, which he saw then as an elite group. A year later, he penned a detailed account in The New Yorker on how he spent his war years up to the death of German dictator Adolf Hitler. Three years ago, Grass drew controversy again, when he published a poem in a German newspaper discouraging Germany from selling more submarines to Israel. In \"What must be said,\" Grass accused Germany of selling weapons to a potential aggressor out of guilt over the Holocaust. Grass said Israel could use nuclear weapons to kill masses of Iranians. German commentators pilloried him as subconsciously anti-Semitic. Israel invoked a visa ban, and then-Interior Minister Eli Yishai declared Grass a \"persona non grata\" in Israel, the Jerusalem Post reported. Grass' novel characters are the forgotten, the downtrodden and the weird, the Nobel committee said. And like Oskar Matzerath, the boy in \"The Tin Drum,\" they often slip into surreal situations. This was a literary innovation, the committee said, which was furthered by other great authors, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nadine Gordimer and Salman Rushdie. On Monday, Rushdie tweeted about Grass' death:  \"This is very sad. A true giant, inspiration, and friend.\" \"The Tin Drum,\" which was published in 1959, \"breaks the bounds of realism by having as its protagonist and narrator an infernal intelligence in the body of a three-year-old, a monster who overpowers the fellow human beings he approaches with the help of a toy drum,\" the Nobel committee wrote. The committee praised Grass' mastery of the German language and his ability to artfully exploit its possibilities of creating seemingly endless yet graceful sentences. Grass was an icon in contemporary German culture with an unchanging iconic look -- his broad mustache, his eyes gazing over the top of his glasses, a tobacco pipe a constant companion in hand. In his later years, he became known for his continuing critique of human history in the 20th century -- and of current events. As recently as March, Grass criticized the anti-Islam movement PEGIDA, Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West. He used the opportunity fire a jab at government that he said was corrupted by money interests. \"It's not Islam that threatens the Federal Republic (of Germany),\" he said in an interview with rp-online.de, \"but political lobbying. Democracy has decayed into fake democracy.\" Grass has also suggested that Germans should be forced to invite refugees from crisis regions to live in their homes as a way of offering more shelter to the world's destitute.", "reference": "Grass tried in his literature to come to grips with World War II and the Nazi era .\nHis characters were the downtrodden, and his style slipped into the surreal .\nHe stoked controversy with his admission to being a member of the Waffen SS .", "pred_summary": "Nobel literature laureate Guenter Grass has died at 87, his publisher says.\nGerman media are reporting he died of pneumonia.\nIn 2006, he confessed that he volunteered for military service in Germany's war of aggression."}

Guerdat and Albfuehren's Paille had the last fence down and narrowly avoided a time fault that would have denied them the outright win. \"I don't really want to think about it,\" he joked. \"Coming to the last I knew the time was tight. \"I just went as fast as I could to the finish line, but unfortunately there was a big fence in the way.\" He added: \"I've been three times on the podium, twice in the jump-off and always finished in the top 10. I always wanted to win this.\" The World Cup Finals are among the most prestigious equestrian titles, but the weekend's events in Las Vegas were notable for the success of younger riders. American dressage rider Laura Graves, a 27-year-old who burst onto the international scene with fifth place at last year's World Equestrian Games, improved to fourth in Vegas. Her performance was outdone by Irish showjumper Bertram Allen, who took bronze on Sunday at the age of 19. The teenager is likely to rise through the ranks of the world's top 10 following that performance, while gaining precious Olympic qualification points. Allen and Molly Malone finished behind French rider Penelope Leprevost, on board Vagabond de la Pomme, who took silver.", "reference": "Olympic champion Charlotte Dujardin remains world's leading dressage rider after Vegas contest .\nSwiss Olympic showjumping champion Steve Guerdat finally wins World Cup jumping title at 10th attempt .", "pred_summary": "Charlotte Dujardin and Valegro win second consecutive Reem Acra FEI World Cup Dressage title.\nTheir score of 94.196 narrowly missed their own world record in the sport.\nYoungster Bertram Allen wins bronze on Sunday at the age of 19."}

The software extracts the relevant colour information from images or artworks found online. The plot above is based on 94,526 images for the years 1800-2000. The graph shows a clear trend toward more blue paintings toward the end of the 20th Century, with all colours increasing except for orange. 'I made a visualization of the change in colors of paintings over time,' said Martin Bellander, a PhD student in psychology at the Karolinska Institute\u00a0who created the graph. To do this, he wrote software first to scrape the images of the paintings from sites where they were available for free download - BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. Then, the software extract the relevant colour information from them, and plots it in a nice way. He found the paintings change over time - from orange to blue. 'The changes in color might be a results of a combination of factor,' he wrote. 'One of these could of course be trends in the use of colour. 'If we assume a smooth linear deterioration of certain colours in oil paintings, it would be possible to subtract that change and study the short term fluctuation in colour use. 'For example the marked increase of blue at the time of the First World War, might actually reflect a true trend in colour use.' Two versions of Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting on show at the National Gallery in in London, England: Yellow and orange are the most popular colours in artworks from 1800, it has been found. Bellander used freely available images for the project.

She is pictured here at her 30th birthday party in Las Vegas when she was fully suffering the effects . 'I had no idea a bug bite could do this,' she said. 'I was bedridden for five months. 'I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk and I couldn't move. I thought I was dying. 'I had complete weakness and fatigue. One night I tried to brush my teeth on the tour bus and couldn't even stand.' 'There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand,' she continued. 'It felt like having all your life sucked out of you.' Symptoms of the disease range from headaches and joint pain to severe fatigue, heart palpitations, paralysis of the face and even dementia. If not caught and treated early enough with antibiotics the condition can persist for years. Sick: The singer, seen her performing at Planet Hollywood in May, told People Magazine she had no idea where she got the tick bite that infected her . The disease was recently\u00a0highlighted\u00a0after Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster contracted it, who reveled she has lost the ability to read, write or even watch TV because of it.

Avril was between the Asian and South American world tour when she first developed symptoms . The musician thinks she may have been bitten last spring, and remembers first waking up on night in April drenched in sweat and feeling feverish. She assumed it was the flu, or even exhaustion and dehydration from touring, but when her\u00a0symptoms\u00a0persisted, some friends who were familiar with the disease\u00a0suggested she might have it.

{"article": "(CNN)This is week three of an ongoing series: A Catholic Reads the Bible. Read week one and week two. When I started this project, my brother texted me, \"Wait until you get to Lot.\" By Sunday afternoon, I understood what he meant. I am horrified by the story of Lot in Genesis. Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was new to me. I actually hadn't put two and two together that Sodom is the origin of the word sodomy. (Feel free to call me dense as you read this). Lot is the central character in the grim story of Sodom and Gomorrah's demise in Chapter 19. You are introduced to the city by Abraham who tries to save the town. In the preceding chapter, Abraham asks God to agree that if he can find 10 good people in the town, God won't smite it. God agrees. Lot is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town. The men of the town come to seek out the new visitors for \"intimacies.\" Ahem. Yeah. Hospitable bunch, huh? Those \"intimacies,\" we are meant to understand, account for Sodom's wickedness. And I guess meant that the town was doomed. (\"Intimacies\" is the term used in my 1991 edition of the New American Bible. The revised edition refers to \"sexual relations.\") To protect the emissaries from the mob, Lot offers up his virginal daughters. Which. Ugh. Anyway, it doesn't work. There apparently aren't enough good men to save Sodom, which leads to God destroying yet another population in Genesis. Oh, and while Lot's chosen family members flee the destruction, Lot's wife turns around and is turned to salt. She had been warned not to look back. After God destroys Sodom, Lot's daughters worry that there aren't any men left, so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him. They need to have children to keep the human race going, the logic goes, I guess. After reading that section, I put my Bible down. I couldn't read anymore. Then I read it again. What was I reading? What are the morals, the meaning, I'm supposed to get from these ghastly stories? This is not the God that I have known for nearly 42 years. It's not the version of the God I pray to daily. I truly don't believe in a God that wipes out a town in general because of sexuality. Why are they wicked? I don't believe that my God that would go after one group -- any group. The God that I pray to doesn't punish the \"wicked\" like this. I can't comprehend this version of God. I can't believe in that kind of God. There were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that I read. But, I want to be truthful with you, my readers. The Lot story struck me -- hard. I wish that I had answers for you as to why this happened or how it was written many years ago. But I don't. It could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children. Or it could be a morality tale for the times. The truth is: I don't really know. I just know that my faith doesn't include the idea of such a punitive God. I now fully understand how you could devote your life to reading and analyzing the Bible. And when I read this rough draft to my brother, he said to me, \"You have just hit the tip of the iceberg.\" So, I will continue reading.", "reference": "This is week three of an ongoing series: A Catholic Reads the Bible.

It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure. A separate study, also commissioned by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoors thinking they were not at risk from the sun and sunburn or were unsure if they were. The study found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoorst hinking they were not at risk . The institution urged businesses to improve 'sun safety', for example by minimising workers' exposure in the middle of the day. More than half (59%) of those questioned reported having had sunburn - a major contributor to skin cancer - at least once in the last year. Researchers also found a 'macho culture' in some parts of the industry and misconceptions about the threat of ultraviolet radiation in climates like the UK's as cloud cover does not give total protection from the sun. The studies' findings are being published as part of an Institution of Occupational Safety and Health No Time To Lose campaign to beat work-related cancers, with businesses urged to develop 'sun safety strategies'. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure . The strategies should include regular updates on the UV index from weather forecasts, minimising sun exposure in the middle of the day and asking employees to wear long-sleeved, loose-fitting tops and trousers. While using high-factor sunscreen is helpful it should not be relied on as the only barrier to the harmful rays, employers are advised. IOSH executive director of policy Shelley Frost said: 'We've a clear picture for the UK now of the number of people diagnosed with or dying from skin cancer because of sun exposure at work. 'It's a terrible disease but with some simple measures we can ensure people who work outside are not exposed to the solar radiation that causes it. 'Work-related skin cancer is avoidable but businesses and their employees hold the key to beating it and today we are showing them how it can be done.'", "reference": "50 die each year as a result of being exposed to the sun at work in Britain .\n250 in jobs like agriculture and construction register skin cancer each year .\nInstitution of Occupational Safety and Health says 'macho culture' to blame .", "pred_summary": "Nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure.\nTwo thirds of workers spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoors.\nMore than half of those questioned reported having had sunburn - a major contributor to skin cancer - at least once in the last year."}

In an emotional open letter, he told how the \u2018bright and beautiful\u2019 GCSE pupil started using a cocktail of banned substances including cocaine, ecstasy, methadone and \u2018party drug\u2019 meow meow. The father \u2013 identified only as John to protect his family\u2019s privacy \u2013 warned that Class A drugs were widely available to children, and urged schools and police to get tough. He said dealers made the drugs \u2018incredibly cheap and available\u2019 to hook their young customers. A father has revealed that his teenage daughter became hooked on cocaine and ecstasy after buying the drugs in the school playground (file pic posed by a model) His daughter was given them for free or paid only a few pounds for pills, sometimes without knowing what she was taking. She had not only put her health in danger but risked sexual abuse by meeting up with men she did not know. The father has sent the open letter to his local council, South Gloucestershire, pleading for action to combat a \u2018serious drug problem\u2019. The man described himself as a single parent to a son and daughter \u2013 referred to as Jack and Jill \u2013 who both went to a local secondary. \u2018Two weeks ago I discovered that Jill had been taking Class A drugs for three to four months,\u2019 he said. \u2018How dumb am I not to know? But do you know the signs as a parent?\u2019 The father said he had initially dismissed changes in his daughter\u2019s behaviour as \u2018teenage moodiness\u2019. He has now written an open letter (above) to his local authority, South Gloucestershire, begging them to take the issue more seriously asking if a young person has to die before the problem is addressed . But he told the Bristol Post: \u2018She came to me and said she had got caught up with a group and started taking cocaine and ecstasy. \u2018I had noticed she had been a bit off but I thought it was a teenage daughter rebelling against her dad \u2026 it just didn\u2019t occur to me and I felt na\u00efve and stupid.\u2019 Horrified by his daughter\u2019s revelations, the father said he went to her school and police but officers were \u2018aggressive and threatening\u2019 when his daughter volunteered information, including the names of alleged dealers. He accused authorities of \u2018pretending a problem doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 and warned the situation would get worse if it was not tackled, adding: \u2018Does a young person here have to die?\u2019 The father said his own investigations had found evidence that illicit drugs were available inside schools and youth clubs. The father, only known as John, has called on South Gloucestershire Council to do more to tackle drug dealing in its schools . He told how he had limited his daughter\u2019s use of her mobile phone and social media, apparently to stop her falling back into drug use. He said he hoped she had stopped before she became hooked. The father said his relationship with his daughter had hit \u2018rock bottom\u2019 over his attempts to protect her from lapsing back into drug abuse, saying: \u2018She hates me now.\u2019 But, in the absence of help from authorities, he said he now believed it was up to parents to try to \u2018take control\u2019 to help their children. The despairing father said he could not offer a \u2018simple answer\u2019 but said the problem of drug use would only get worse if it was ignored. South Gloucestershire council refused to comment and said it was a matter for police. Inspector Adrian Fallows, a neighbourhood police manager for South Gloucestershire, said: \u2018We are working with schools to educate young people about drugs and also to deal firmly with any drugs issues that may arise. \u2018The supply, production and use of drugs in our communities, and the acquisitive crimes associated with drugs, is a serious matter. \u2018We will do whatever we can to protect young people by disrupting the system and bringing to justice anyone dealing drugs and profiting from crime.\u2019", "reference": "Father, only known as John, noticed his daughter was acting strangely .\nConfronted her and she confessed taking cocaine, ecstasy and MCAT .\nTold him drugs were available to buy at school, parks and youth groups .\nFather is now calling on local authority to take the issue more seriously .", "pred_summary": "'bright and beautiful' GCSE pupil started using a cocktail of banned substances.\nCocaine, ecstasy, methadone and 'party drug' meow meow - all available at schools.\nDad claims she was given them for free or paid only a few pounds for pills.\nHe accuses authorities of'Pretending a problem doesn't exist'"}
{"article": "It seems that scoring stunning volleys in Tyne-Wear derbies is not the limit of Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe's limits as he shows off his impressive keepy up skills with a tennis ball. Fresh from his heroics on Sunday when he struck a brilliant volley to earn his side victory against Newcastle at the Stadium of Light, Defoe was the first player to take part in Sunderland's keepy up challenge. The former Tottenham forward set an impressive score of 76 for his team-mates to beat before taking the second part of the challenge - keepy ups with a Creme Egg. Tyne-Wear derby hero Jermain Defoe takes on the Sunderland keepy up challenge . The former Tottenham and West Ham striker is the first Sunderland player to take the challenge . Defoe eventually sets an impressive score of 76 for his team-mates to attempt to beat . Defoe was unable to replicate the high score achieved with the tennis ball but managed to post a respectable-looking nine with the Easter treat. Defoe was overcome with emotion in the wake of his brilliant blast, and admits the joy it brought to a sold-out Stadium of Light was too much to take in. 'I have said many times that I missed the Premier League and it's because of games like this,' he said. 'Games like this are why I came back. Being at a club like this, they just love football. I was told before that if I come here and work hard and score goals, they won't ask for anything more. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe celebrates after scoring a stunning volley against Newcastle . Defoe's superb first-half strike was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby . Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was completely helpless as Defoe's shot found its way into the top corner . 'And I just love scoring goals, the fans deserved it. It's been really difficult for them in the last few weeks but they always turn out. 'It was the whole occasion really that got to me. It was great to be the person that made so many people happy. I was just thinking, \"Why me?\". 'As the whistle went for half-time and as I was walking down the tunnel I thought, \"I'm crying and I'm on the telly\", but I didn't care. For the fans and everyone it was just a special day.' The 32-year-old not only wrote his name into Sunderland folklore with his derby winner at the weekend but boosted Dick Advocaat's side survival hopes.

{"article": "A mysterious sinkhole spewing fire and incredible heat has appeared in a Chinese hillside. Geologists and media have flocked to the desolate mountain on the outskirts of Urumqi, in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in north-western China, since it appeared a few weeks ago. Scroll down for video . The hole appeared recently after locals noticed the ground nearby getting warmer . The heat blasting from the 'ring of fire' has been measured at 792C (1457F) from two metres away, reports People's Daily Online, and is so intense that experts can't get close enough to determine how deep the hole is. Video footage of the 3ft-wide hole shows locals igniting branches and grass by pushing it to the rim. Some Chinese internet users have branded it a 'gateway to hell' after viewing the pictures. Experts can't get close enough to determine how deep the mysterious hole is . The temperature has been measured at 792C - but that was from two metres away . Locals told Chinese media that they had noticed the ground in the area had been warm underfoot for some time. The hill is not in a volcanic area, and experts from Xinjiang Meitian Geological Bureau think the hole is caused by the layer of spontaneously combusted coal underneath the ground, which leads the surface layer to collapse. \u2018The phenomenon has existed in the area for a few decades,\u2019 Huang Wei, an engineer from the bureau told China Central TV Station. He added that smoke often comes from under the ground on this hill in the spring and autumn. Branches and grass that are held near the hole immediately catch fire from the intense heat . Experts think a coal seam may have spontaneously combusted below ground . Chen Long, a supervisor from Xinjiang Meitian Fire Engineering Bureau, said there used to be more than a dozen of small coal mines in the area in the 1970s. \u2018Primitive mining and extinguishing techniques caused coal to burn deep under the ground,\u2019 said Mr Chen in the same interview. \u2018Operators didn\u2019t seal the mines properly after business discontinued and this leads the underground fire to burn towards the surface of the earth.\u2019 The local authorities have started drawing plans to put out the underground fire.", "reference": "Locals had noticed the ground in the area was warmer than usual .\nExperts can't get close enough to determine how deep the hole is .\nTemperature measured at 792C from two metres away .\nThought to be caused by a coal seam spontaneously combusting .", "pred_summary": "3ft-wide sinkhole appeared on outskirts of Urumqi in north-western China.\nLocals had noticed ground had been warm for some time.\nExperts think hole is caused by layer of spontaneously combusted coal underneath the ground."}

It was the ninth career title for the top-seeded Japanese, who again showed his improved endurance as he battled to come out on top against the world number 66. 'I didn't think about winning the tournament at the start of the week because of the strength of the players here, especially the Spanish, but now I am very happy,' Nishikori told reporters. Pop star Shakira and husband Gerard Pique attend the final during day seven of the Barcelona Open . Spain defender Pique holds his son Milan during the final of the Barcelona Open at the Real Club de Tenis . 'I knew that Andujar has a good backhand and my plan was to move the ball around a bit. It worked well in the last few games and then with the final shot I closed my eyes and it went in.' Andujar broke serve in the opening game with Nishikori making uncharacteristic mistakes and the score was 2-2 before either player held serve. Nishikori found himself being dragged out of position by Andujar, who had beaten third seed David Ferrer in the semi-finals but, despite racking up 13 unforced errors, he still managed to break his opponent again at 5-4 to win the first set. Pique played in Barcelona's 2-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday which kept them top in La Liga . The famous couple share a kiss in between points as Pablo Andujar missed opportunities to clinch the first set . Nishikori continued to make mistakes as the Spaniard went into a 2-0 lead in the next and then survived a break point to go 3-1 ahead.

Nishikori exploded on the tennis scene last year, reaching his first ever Grand Slam final at the US Open and he will be among the favourites to win the French Open next month. Strong from the back of the court, he is well suited to clay courts, also having reached the final of the Madrid Open in 2014 where he had to retire injured against Rafael Nadal.
